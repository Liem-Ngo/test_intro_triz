    "text": "TRIZ, an acronym for the Russian phrase “Teoriya Resheniya Izobretatelskikh Zadach,” translates to the “Theory of Inventive Problem Solving” in English. Developed by Genrich Altshuller and his colleagues in the former Soviet Union, TRIZ has evolved from its origins in the 1940s into a comprehensive system for innovative thinking and creativity.\n\n\nAt its core, TRIZ is a problem-solving, analysis, and forecasting tool derived from the study of patterns of invention in global patent literature. Unlike traditional problem-solving methods that often rely on trial and error or random brainstorming, TRIZ provides a systematic approach to innovation.\nKey aspects of TRIZ as a problem-solving tool include:\n\nSystematic Innovation: TRIZ challenges the notion that innovation is purely a result of spontaneous inspiration. Instead, it posits that innovation follows certain patterns and principles that can be identified, learned, and applied.\nPatent-Based Knowledge: TRIZ is built on the analysis of hundreds of thousands of patents from various fields. This extensive study revealed that many innovative solutions across different domains rely on a relatively small number of inventive principles.\nConceptual Problem Solving: Rather than providing specific technical solutions, TRIZ offers conceptual solutions that can be adapted to various fields and problems. This makes TRIZ a versatile tool applicable across different industries and disciplines.\n\n\n\n\nTRIZ is a unique, rigorous, and powerful toolkit that guides engineers to understand and solve their problems by accessing the immense treasure of past engineering and scientific knowledge. It offers several advantages:\n\nAccess to Global Knowledge: TRIZ condenses the world’s innovative knowledge into a set of tools and principles, allowing engineers to tap into solutions from fields outside their specific expertise.\nEfficiency in Problem Solving: By providing a structured approach to innovation, TRIZ helps engineers find relevant and practical answers to real problems more quickly and efficiently than traditional methods.\nOvercoming Psychological Inertia: TRIZ tools are designed to help engineers break free from conventional thinking patterns, encouraging them to explore novel solutions they might not have considered otherwise.\n\n\n\n\nWhat sets TRIZ apart from other problem-solving methodologies is its ability to:\n\nDistill Complex Problems: TRIZ helps in breaking down complex problems into their fundamental components, making them easier to analyze and solve.\nIdentify Contradictions: A key concept in TRIZ is the identification and resolution of contradictions within a system. This focus on contradictions often leads to breakthrough solutions.\nLeverage Patterns of Evolution: TRIZ recognizes that technical systems evolve according to certain patterns. Understanding these patterns allows for more accurate prediction and direction of future innovations.\n\n\n\n\nTo illustrate how TRIZ works in practice, consider the following example:\nProblem: A manufacturing company needs to increase the strength of a metal component without adding weight.\nTraditional Approach: Engineers might try different alloys or redesign the component through trial and error, which could be time-consuming and costly.\nTRIZ Approach: 1. Identify the contradiction: Increasing strength typically increases weight. 2. Consult the TRIZ Contradiction Matrix: This tool might suggest the principle of “Segmentation” or “Composite Materials.” 3. Apply the principle: The engineers might decide to use a composite material that combines lightweight and high-strength properties, or redesign the component with a honeycomb structure for strength without added weight.\nThis TRIZ-guided approach leads to innovative solutions more efficiently by leveraging proven problem-solving principles.\n\n\n\nWhile TRIZ originated in the field of engineering, its principles have been successfully applied to various domains, including:\n\nBusiness and management\nSoftware development\nEducation\nSocial issues\nEnvironmental challenges\n\nThis broad applicability demonstrates the versatility and power of TRIZ as a problem-solving and innovation tool.\nIn essence, TRIZ is not just a set of tools, but a way of thinking that encourages systematic innovation. It empowers problem solvers to tap into the collective knowledge of inventors across time and disciplines, offering a unique and powerful approach to tackling complex challenges in our rapidly evolving world.\n\n\n\n\nThe history of TRIZ is intricately tied to the life and work of its founder, Genrich Altshuller, and the socio-political context of the Soviet Union in the mid-20th century. This section explores the origins of TRIZ, its development over time, and the key discoveries that shaped this innovative problem-solving methodology.\n\n\nTRIZ originated in 1946 when Genrich Altshuller, a young Soviet naval engineer and patent clerk, began his groundbreaking work on inventive problem solving. Born in 1926 in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, Altshuller showed an early aptitude for invention, receiving his first patent at the age of 14.\nKey events in the early development of TRIZ include:\n\n1946: While working in the patent office of the Caspian Sea flotilla, Altshuller noticed patterns in how inventive problems were solved across different fields. This observation sparked his lifelong quest to understand and systematize the inventive process.\n1948: Altshuller wrote a letter to Stalin, criticizing the state of invention in the Soviet Union and proposing a new approach. This led to his arrest and imprisonment in the Gulag until 1954.\n1956: Upon his release and rehabilitation, Altshuller published his first paper on TRIZ, introducing the concept of technical contradictions.\n\n\n\n\nCentral to the development of TRIZ was Altshuller’s extensive analysis of patent literature. Over several decades, Altshuller and his growing team of researchers examined over 200,000 patents from around the world. This monumental task aimed to distill the essence of inventive problem-solving, regardless of the specific field or technology involved.\nKey findings from the patent analysis:\n\nPatterns of Innovation: Despite the vast diversity of technologies and industries, many innovative solutions relied on a relatively small number of inventive principles.\nLevels of Invention: Altshuller classified inventions into five levels, ranging from routine design problems to pioneering inventions that create new fields of engineering.\n40 Inventive Principles: Through this analysis, Altshuller identified 40 fundamental principles that inventors used to solve problems and create innovations.\nContradiction Matrix: Altshuller developed a matrix to help inventors quickly identify which principles were most likely to resolve specific technical contradictions.\n\n\n\n\nThe development of TRIZ was not a one-time event but an ongoing process of refinement and expansion. Key milestones in its evolution include:\n\n1961: The first TRIZ seminar was held in Azerbaijan, marking the beginning of TRIZ as a teachable methodology.\n1969-1984: Altshuller developed ARIZ (Algorithm for Inventive Problem Solving), a step-by-step method for solving complex inventive problems. ARIZ went through several iterations, becoming increasingly sophisticated.\n1971: The first TRIZ school was established in Baku, Azerbaijan, formalizing the teaching of TRIZ.\n1970s-1980s: TRIZ continued to evolve with the addition of new tools and concepts, such as the Law of Ideality, the concept of physical contradictions, and the theory of technical system evolution.\n1989: The first international TRIZ conference was held in Petrozavodsk, Russia, marking the beginning of TRIZ’s global spread.\n\n\n\n\nThe collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s led to a rapid spread of TRIZ beyond its original borders:\n\n1990s: TRIZ began to gain recognition in the West, with companies like Procter & Gamble, Ford, and Boeing adopting TRIZ methodologies.\n1997: The Altshuller Institute for TRIZ Studies was founded in the United States, helping to promote TRIZ internationally.\n2000s-Present: TRIZ continues to evolve and adapt, with researchers and practitioners around the world developing new applications and integrating TRIZ with other methodologies like Six Sigma and Lean Manufacturing.\n\n\n\n\nAltshuller’s work on TRIZ has had a profound impact on the field of innovation and problem-solving:\n\nSystematic Approach to Innovation: TRIZ challenged the notion that innovation was purely a result of random inspiration, demonstrating that inventive problem-solving could be taught and learned.\nCross-Industry Application: By identifying universal principles of innovation, TRIZ enabled the transfer of solutions between seemingly unrelated fields.\nEducational Impact: TRIZ has been incorporated into engineering curricula at universities worldwide, shaping a new generation of innovative thinkers.\nCorporate Adoption: Many leading companies have adopted TRIZ as part of their innovation and problem-solving processes, demonstrating its practical value in real-world applications.\n\nThe historical development of TRIZ reflects a remarkable journey from one man’s insight to a globally recognized methodology for innovation. As TRIZ continues to evolve and adapt to new challenges, its core principles remain a testament to Altshuller’s vision of systematizing the creative process.\n\n\n\n\nTRIZ is built upon several fundamental concepts that form the foundation of its problem-solving methodology. Understanding these core concepts is crucial for effectively applying TRIZ in practice. This section explores the three primary concepts: Ideality, Contradictions, and Patterns of Evolution.\n\n\nThe concept of Ideality is central to TRIZ thinking and serves as a guiding principle for all problem-solving efforts.\n\n\nIdeality is expressed mathematically as:\nIdeality = (Sum of all Benefits) / (Sum of Costs + Sum of Harms)\nThis formula encapsulates the goal of any technical system or solution: to maximize benefits while minimizing costs and harmful effects.\n\n\n\n\nBenefits: All useful functions and outcomes of a system.\nCosts: All resources required to create and operate the system, including materials, energy, labor, and time.\nHarms: Any negative effects or undesired outcomes produced by the system.\n\n\n\n\nThe pursuit of Ideality drives innovation in TRIZ by encouraging:\n\nIncreasing Benefits: Finding ways to enhance the useful functions of a system.\nReducing Costs: Minimizing the resources required for a system to operate.\nEliminating Harms: Removing or mitigating any negative effects of the system.\n\n\n\n\nConsider the evolution of lighting technology:\n\nIncandescent Bulb: Low ideality due to high energy consumption (cost) and heat generation (harm) relative to light output (benefit).\nLED Light: Higher ideality with increased light output (benefit), lower energy consumption (reduced cost), and minimal heat generation (reduced harm).\n\nThe progression from incandescent to LED lighting demonstrates the pursuit of increased Ideality in technological evolution.\n\n\n\nAn extension of the Ideality concept is the Ideal Final Result (IFR), which represents the ultimate goal of a system where: - All benefits are achieved - No costs are incurred - No harm is produced\nWhile the IFR is often practically unattainable, it serves as a powerful thinking tool to guide innovation towards more ideal solutions.\n\n\n\n\nTRIZ posits that at the heart of many inventive problems lie contradictions. Resolving these contradictions often leads to innovative solutions.\n\n\nTRIZ identifies two main types of contradictions:\n\nTechnical Contradictions:\n\nDefinition: Improving one parameter of a system causes another parameter to worsen.\nExample: Increasing the strength of a material often increases its weight, which may be undesirable.\n\nPhysical Contradictions:\n\nDefinition: A single aspect of a system has conflicting requirements.\nExample: A coffee cup needs to be hot to keep the coffee warm but cool to hold comfortably.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRIZ provides several tools for resolving contradictions:\n\nContradiction Matrix: A tool that suggests inventive principles based on the specific technical contradiction being addressed.\nSeparation Principles: For physical contradictions, TRIZ suggests separating the conflicting requirements in space, time, or condition.\n40 Inventive Principles: A set of strategies derived from patent analysis that can be applied to resolve various types of contradictions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAircraft wing design presents a fundamental challenge in aeronautical engineering. An airplane wing must simultaneously fulfill two seemingly contradictory requirements:\n\nIt must be strong and stiff enough to withstand the tremendous forces experienced during flight, including lift, drag, and turbulence. This strength is crucial for maintaining structural integrity and ensuring flight stability and safety.\nIt should also be capable of adapting its shape to optimize aerodynamics across various flight conditions. This adaptability can significantly improve fuel efficiency by reducing drag and allowing the wing to perform optimally during different phases of flight (takeoff, cruising, landing).\n\nThe challenge lies in reconciling these opposing needs without compromising either aspect.\n\n\n\nTRIZ identifies this as a technical contradiction:\n\nImproving Parameter: #14 Strength\n“The extent to which the object is able to resist changing in response to force. Resistance to breaking.”\nWorsening Parameter: #35 Adaptability or versatility\n“The extent to which a system/object positively responds to external changes. Also, a system that can be used in multiple ways under a variety of circumstances.”\n\nThis contradiction encapsulates the core challenge: as we increase the wing’s strength, we typically decrease its adaptability, and vice versa.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis principle suggests making an object adjustable or adaptive to optimize its performance under different conditions.\n\nVariable Geometry Wing: Design a wing that can change its shape during flight. This could involve adjustable sweep angles, extendable surfaces, or morphing wing sections. For example, the wing could extend its surface area for takeoff and landing (when maximum lift is needed) and retract for high-speed cruising (to reduce drag).\nAdjustable Internal Supports: Implement a system of dynamic internal struts or supports that can alter the wing’s stiffness in real-time. These could be pneumatic, hydraulic, or electromechanical systems that adjust based on flight data, stiffening the wing during high-load conditions and relaxing it for better efficiency during steady flight.\nShape-Memory Alloys: Incorporate materials like Nitinol (a nickel-titanium alloy) into the wing structure. These alloys can change their shape and properties in response to temperature changes or electrical stimulation, allowing the wing to adapt its form without complex mechanical systems.\n\n\n\n\nThis principle involves transitioning from a homogeneous structure or environment to one with diverse properties.\n\nGradient Properties: Design the wing with varying material properties along its span and chord. This could involve using different materials or changing the density, thickness, or composition of materials across the wing.\nDifferential Stiffness: Create a wing with a stiffer root section (where it connects to the fuselage) for strength and load-bearing, gradually transitioning to a more flexible tip. This mimics natural structures like tree branches or bird wings, which are stiffer at the base and more flexible at the extremities.\nStrategic Fiber Orientation: In composite materials, carefully design the orientation of reinforcing fibers. For example, align fibers longitudinally near the wing root for maximum stiffness, and orient them differently towards the wingtip to allow for more flexibility and twist.\n\n\n\n\nIn TRIZ, “color changes” is often interpreted more broadly as changing the properties or characteristics of a system.\n\nSmart Materials: Integrate materials like piezoelectric ceramics or electroactive polymers into the wing skin. These materials can change their shape or stiffness when an electric current is applied, allowing for precise, localized control of wing properties.\nPiezoelectric Actuation: Embed piezoelectric actuators throughout the wing structure. When activated by electric currents, these can induce small deformations in the wing shape, allowing for fine control of aerodynamic properties without large, heavy mechanical systems.\nMicro-Fluidic Networks: Develop a system of small channels within the wing structure that can be filled with fluids of different viscosities. By pumping these fluids, the wing’s rigidity and shape can be dynamically adjusted. This mimics how plants control their structure through hydraulic systems.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe proposed wing design integrates all three principles into a cohesive system:\n\nDynamic Structure: The wing utilizes variable geometry and shape-memory alloys to make large-scale adaptations to flight conditions. This allows for optimal performance during different flight phases, from takeoff to cruising to landing.\nOptimized Material Distribution: The wing’s internal structure is designed with varying properties along its length and chord. This ensures maximum strength where needed (like at the wing root) while allowing for flexibility and adaptability in other areas (like the wingtip).\nSmart Material Systems: Piezoelectric materials and micro-fluidic networks provide fine-grained control over the wing’s properties. These systems can make small, rapid adjustments to optimize aerodynamics in real-time, responding to changing atmospheric conditions or flight requirements.\n\nThis integrated solution aims to create a wing that is both strong and adaptable, capable of maintaining structural integrity under high loads while also optimizing its shape for maximum efficiency across a range of flight conditions. By leveraging advanced materials and innovative design concepts, this TRIZ-inspired solution potentially resolves the fundamental contradiction in wing design, offering improvements in both stability and fuel efficiency without compromising either aspect.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRIZ has identified that technical systems tend to evolve in predictable patterns, regardless of the specific industry or technology involved.\n\n\n\nIncreasing Ideality: Systems evolve towards increased Ideality over time.\nNon-Uniform Development of System Elements: Different parts of a system evolve at different rates, leading to new contradictions and opportunities for innovation.\nTransition from Macro to Micro Level: Systems tend to evolve from using macro-level working principles to micro-level ones (e.g., mechanical systems to electronic to molecular).\nIncreasing Dynamism and Controllability: Systems become more flexible, dynamic, and controllable over time.\nIncreasing Complexity followed by Simplification: Systems often become more complex as they evolve, then are simplified through integration and removal of redundant parts.\nMatching and Mismatching of Parts: The coordination (or lack thereof) between parts of a system drives evolution.\nTransition to the Super-system: Individual systems often evolve by merging with other systems or moving to a higher level.\nTransition to Micro-level and Use of Fields: There’s a trend towards miniaturization and increased use of various fields (electromagnetic, acoustic, etc.) in system operation.\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding these patterns allows TRIZ practitioners to: 1. Predict future developments in technical systems 2. Identify opportunities for innovation by determining where a system is in its evolutionary path 3. Guide research and development efforts towards the most promising directions\n\n\n\nConsider the evolution of data storage: 1. Paper records (macro level) 2. Magnetic tape (transition to fields) 3. Floppy disks (increasing dynamism) 4. Hard drives (increasing complexity) 5. Solid-state drives (simplification, transition to micro-level) 6. Cloud storage (transition to super-system)\nThis evolution demonstrates several TRIZ patterns, including the transition from macro to micro level, increasing dynamism, and the move towards super-systems.\nBy understanding and applying these core concepts of Ideality, Contradictions, and Patterns of Evolution, TRIZ practitioners can approach problem-solving and innovation with a powerful set of tools and perspectives, leading to more effective and creative solutions.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe TRIZ methodology offers a comprehensive set of tools and techniques for systematic innovation and problem-solving. This section explores the key components of the TRIZ Toolkit, its applications across various fields, the benefits of using TRIZ, and the process of learning and applying TRIZ.\n\n\nThe TRIZ Toolkit comprises several powerful tools, each designed to address specific aspects of the problem-solving process:\n\n40 Inventive Principles: These are fundamental strategies for solving technical contradictions, derived from the analysis of patents across various fields.\nContradiction Matrix: A tool that helps identify which of the 40 Inventive Principles are most likely to resolve specific technical contradictions.\n76 Standard Solutions: A set of solution patterns for solving system problems, particularly useful when working with Substance-Field models.\n8 Trends of Technical Evolution: Patterns that describe how technical systems tend to evolve over time, useful for predicting future developments and identifying innovation opportunities.\nEffects Database: A collection of physical, chemical, and geometric effects that can be applied to solve technical problems.\nFunction Analysis and Substance-Field Analysis: Tools for modeling and analyzing systems in terms of their functions and interactions.\nIdeal Final Result (IFR): A concept that encourages thinking about the ultimate, idealized solution to a problem.\nResources and Trimming: Techniques for identifying and utilizing available resources and simplifying systems.\nARIZ (Algorithm for Inventive Problem Solving): A structured process for solving complex inventive problems that don’t yield to simpler TRIZ techniques.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to its analytical tools, TRIZ offers several creativity tools designed to overcome psychological inertia and stimulate innovative thinking. These tools help practitioners break free from conventional thought patterns, visualize problems and solutions in new ways, and generate innovative ideas. Let’s explore these tools in detail:\n\n\nThe Ideal Final Result is a fundamental concept in TRIZ that encourages envisioning the perfect solution without constraints.\nHow it works: 1. Define the ultimate goal or function of the system. 2. Imagine this function being performed perfectly, without any mechanisms or costs. 3. Work backwards from this ideal to identify potential paths to achieve it.\nExample: For a car windshield wiper system, the IFR might be: “The windshield cleans itself instantaneously, without any mechanism or energy input.”\nBenefit: IFR helps break psychological inertia by forcing consideration of radical improvements rather than incremental ones.\n\n\n\nSmart Little People is a modeling technique that represents system elements as intelligent agents.\nHow it works: 1. Imagine the system or problem area filled with tiny, intelligent beings. 2. Assign these “people” roles that represent different parts or functions of the system. 3. Visualize how these smart little people interact to perform the system’s function or solve the problem.\nExample: In designing a better tire, imagine smart little people forming the rubber compound, gripping the road, and flexing to absorb shocks.\nBenefit: SLP provides a fresh perspective on system interactions and can reveal new approaches to problem-solving.\n\n\n\nThe Size-Time-Cost Operator is a tool for considering extreme variations in a system’s parameters.\nHow it works: Consider six extreme scenarios: 1. What if the size becomes zero? Or infinitely large? 2. What if the process time becomes zero? Or infinitely long? 3. What if the cost becomes zero? Or if cost is no object?\nExample: For improving a coffee maker, consider: “What if it were microscopic? What if it were as big as a house? What if it made coffee instantly? What if it took a year?”\nBenefit: STC helps generate radical ideas by pushing beyond normal boundaries of thinking.\n\n\n\nThe Nine-screen Diagram is a method for analyzing a system across different levels of complexity and time frames.\nHow it works: Create a 3x3 grid: - Columns represent past, present, and future. - Rows represent subsystem, system, and supersystem.\nExample: For a bicycle, consider: - Subsystem (e.g., wheels) in past, present, future - Bicycle system in past, present, future - Transportation supersystem in past, present, future\nBenefit: This tool provides a comprehensive view of the system’s evolution and context, often revealing new innovation opportunities.\n\n\n\nThis technique involves applying attributes of random objects to the problem at hand.\nHow it works: 1. Select a random object unrelated to your problem. 2. List its attributes. 3. Apply these attributes to your problem or system.\nExample: To innovate a new chair design, select a random object like “cloud.” Attributes might include “fluffy,” “changeable,” “floating.” Apply these to chair design.\nBenefit: This method generates unexpected combinations and ideas, pushing beyond conventional thinking.\n\n\n\nThis tool encourages considering problems and solutions across various time scales and levels of detail.\nHow it works: 1. Consider the problem at different time scales (e.g., microseconds to years). 2. Examine the system at different physical scales (e.g., atomic to global).\nExample: For improving data storage, consider storage needs from microseconds of processor cache to years of archival, and from individual bits to global data centers.\nBenefit: This approach can reveal overlooked aspects of the problem and potential solution areas.\n\n\n\nTRIZ emphasizes identifying and utilizing available resources in innovative ways.\nHow it works: 1. List all resources in and around the system (material, energy, information, time, space). 2. Consider how each resource could be used to solve the problem or improve the system.\nExample: In improving a refrigerator’s efficiency, consider using the heat generated by the compressor for other purposes, like warming a compartment for defrosting foods.\nBenefit: This tool promotes cost-effective, elegant solutions by making better use of existing resources.\n\n\n\nAFD is a reverse brainstorming technique used to identify and prevent potential failures.\nHow it works: 1. Instead of asking “How can we prevent failures?”, ask “How can we make this system fail?” 2. List all possible ways to cause failure. 3. Use this list to identify and address vulnerabilities.\nExample: For a new smartphone design, brainstorm all possible ways to make it fail (drop it, overheat it, expose to water, etc.), then design preventive measures.\nBenefit: AFD helps identify non-obvious failure modes and improve system reliability.\n\n\n\nThe application of TRIZ methodology offers numerous benefits:\n\nSystematic and Guaranteed Innovation: TRIZ provides a structured approach to innovation, increasing the likelihood of finding effective solutions.\nAccelerated Problem-Solving: By directing focus to the most promising solution areas, TRIZ can significantly speed up the problem-solving process.\nOvercoming Psychological Inertia: TRIZ tools help break free from conventional thinking patterns that often limit creative problem-solving.\nSimplifying Systems while Retaining Functionality: Techniques like Trimming allow for system optimization without loss of essential functions.\nAccessing Global Knowledge and Proven Solutions: TRIZ leverages solutions from across industries and disciplines, allowing for knowledge transfer.\nImproved Team Collaboration and Idea Sharing: TRIZ provides a common language and framework for teams to approach problems collaboratively.\n\n\n\n\nWhile TRIZ originated in engineering, its principles and tools have been successfully applied across various fields:\n\nBusiness and Management: For strategic planning, process improvement, and organizational innovation.\nEducation: In developing teaching methods and curricula, and fostering creative thinking in students.\nScientific Research: For hypothesis generation, experimental design, and problem framing in scientific inquiries.\nProduct Development: In all stages of product lifecycle, from concept generation to optimization and improvement.\nProcess Optimization: For enhancing efficiency and effectiveness in manufacturing and service processes.\nSoftware Development: In designing algorithms, user interfaces, and solving complex coding challenges.\nEnvironmental Issues: For developing sustainable technologies and solving ecological problems.\nSocial Innovation: In addressing complex societal challenges and developing social enterprises.\n\n\n\n\nTRIZ (Theory of Inventive Problem Solving) stands out among problem-solving methodologies in several significant ways. This section explores how TRIZ compares to other well-known problem-solving and innovation methods, highlighting its unique features and advantages.\n\n\nWhile many problem-solving methods focus on problem analysis or solution selection, TRIZ provides tools for the crucial stage of concept generation.\nComparison with Other Methods:\n\nSix Sigma: Primarily focuses on problem identification and process improvement, but lacks specific tools for innovative solution generation.\nDesign Thinking: Emphasizes understanding user needs and rapid prototyping, but relies more on intuitive creativity for solution generation.\nTRIZ: Offers specific tools like the 40 Inventive Principles and the Effects Database to systematically generate innovative concepts.\n\nExample: In developing a new packaging solution, Six Sigma might help identify inefficiencies in the current process, and Design Thinking might uncover user preferences, but TRIZ could generate novel concepts like “nested packaging” using principles such as “Nesting” (#7) from the 40 Inventive Principles.\n\n\n\nUnlike brainstorming, which relies on random associations, TRIZ offers a structured path to creative solutions.\nComparison with Other Methods:\n\nBrainstorming: Generates ideas through free association, which can be hit-or-miss and influenced by group dynamics.\nLateral Thinking: Encourages looking at problems from different perspectives but doesn’t provide a systematic framework for doing so.\nTRIZ: Provides structured tools like the Contradiction Matrix and ARIZ (Algorithm for Inventive Problem Solving) to guide the creative process systematically.\n\nExample: To improve battery life in a smartphone, brainstorming might yield incremental ideas like “bigger battery” or “more efficient chips.” TRIZ, using the Contradiction Matrix, might suggest the principle of “Segmentation” to create a modular battery system or “Another Dimension” to explore 3D battery architectures.\n\n\n\nTRIZ facilitates the application of solutions from one field to problems in another, fostering interdisciplinary innovation.\nComparison with Other Methods:\n\nBenchmarking: Typically limited to comparing within the same industry or similar processes.\nAnalogical Thinking: Encourages drawing parallels but doesn’t provide a systematic way to do so across diverse fields.\nTRIZ: Through tools like the Effects Database and Standard Solutions, TRIZ actively promotes cross-industry solution transfer.\n\nExample: When tackling the problem of reducing aircraft noise, TRIZ might suggest looking at how nature solves similar problems, leading to the development of owl-inspired serrated engine components, a solution that might not arise through traditional aviation industry benchmarking.\n\n\n\nTRIZ’s unique focus on identifying and resolving contradictions often leads to breakthrough solutions.\nComparison with Other Methods:\n\nTrade-off Analysis: Typically seeks to find an optimal balance between conflicting parameters.\nCompromise Solutions: Many methods aim to find a middle ground between conflicting requirements.\nTRIZ: Specifically aims to resolve contradictions without compromise, often leading to innovative solutions that satisfy seemingly incompatible requirements.\n\nExample: In developing a new tire, a trade-off analysis might seek a balance between grip and durability. TRIZ, using the Separation Principles, might suggest a solution where the tire changes its properties dynamically, providing high grip when needed and high durability at other times.\n\n\n\nThrough its Trends of Evolution, TRIZ offers insights into future technological developments.\nComparison with Other Methods:\n\nTrend Analysis: Often based on extrapolating current trends, which can miss disruptive innovations.\nScenario Planning: Creates multiple possible futures but doesn’t provide guidance on likely technological evolutions.\nTRIZ: Offers specific Trends of Technical Evolution that have been observed across various fields, providing a framework for predicting future developments.\n\nExample: In predicting the evolution of computer interfaces, trend analysis might suggest incremental improvements in touch screens. TRIZ’s Trends, such as “Transition to the Super-system” and “Increasing Degree of Substance-Field Interactions,” might point towards the development of brain-computer interfaces or ambient computing environments.\n\n\n\nTRIZ provides a comprehensive toolkit that addresses various aspects of the innovation process.\nComparison with Other Methods:\n\nLean: Focuses primarily on process efficiency and waste reduction.\nAgile: Emphasizes iterative development and flexibility but doesn’t provide specific innovation tools.\nTRIZ: Offers tools for problem analysis (e.g., Function Analysis), concept generation (e.g., 40 Principles), and future forecasting (Trends of Evolution), providing a more complete innovation toolkit.\n\nExample: In developing a new product, Lean might help optimize the production process, and Agile could guide the development cycle, but TRIZ could assist in all phases - from initial concept generation to predicting future product iterations.\n\n\n\nTRIZ emphasizes the identification and utilization of available resources, often leading to cost-effective and elegant solutions.\nComparison with Other Methods:\n\nValue Engineering: Focuses on cost reduction while maintaining function, but doesn’t provide specific tools for identifying untapped resources.\nBlue Ocean Strategy: Seeks to create new market spaces but doesn’t specifically focus on resource utilization.\nTRIZ: Provides tools like the Resources Checklist and Substance-Field Analysis to systematically identify and utilize available resources in innovative ways.\n\nExample: In improving a water purification system, Value Engineering might focus on reducing component costs. TRIZ, through its resource-centric approach, might identify ways to use waste heat from the process to enhance purification efficiency, turning a “waste” into a valuable resource."

    "text": "TRIZ, an acronym for the Russian phrase “Teoriya Resheniya Izobretatelskikh Zadach,” translates to the “Theory of Inventive Problem Solving” in English. Developed by Genrich Altshuller and his colleagues in the former Soviet Union, TRIZ has evolved from its origins in the 1940s into a comprehensive system for innovative thinking and creativity.\n\n\nAt its core, TRIZ is a problem-solving, analysis, and forecasting tool derived from the study of patterns of invention in global patent literature. Unlike traditional problem-solving methods that often rely on trial and error or random brainstorming, TRIZ provides a systematic approach to innovation.\nKey aspects of TRIZ as a problem-solving tool include:\n\nSystematic Innovation: TRIZ challenges the notion that innovation is purely a result of spontaneous inspiration. Instead, it posits that innovation follows certain patterns and principles that can be identified, learned, and applied.\nPatent-Based Knowledge: TRIZ is built on the analysis of hundreds of thousands of patents from various fields. This extensive study revealed that many innovative solutions across different domains rely on a relatively small number of inventive principles.\nConceptual Problem Solving: Rather than providing specific technical solutions, TRIZ offers conceptual solutions that can be adapted to various fields and problems. This makes TRIZ a versatile tool applicable across different industries and disciplines.\n\n\n\n\nTRIZ is a unique, rigorous, and powerful toolkit that guides engineers to understand and solve their problems by accessing the immense treasure of past engineering and scientific knowledge. It offers several advantages:\n\nAccess to Global Knowledge: TRIZ condenses the world’s innovative knowledge into a set of tools and principles, allowing engineers to tap into solutions from fields outside their specific expertise.\nEfficiency in Problem Solving: By providing a structured approach to innovation, TRIZ helps engineers find relevant and practical answers to real problems more quickly and efficiently than traditional methods.\nOvercoming Psychological Inertia: TRIZ tools are designed to help engineers break free from conventional thinking patterns, encouraging them to explore novel solutions they might not have considered otherwise.\n\n\n\n\nWhat sets TRIZ apart from other problem-solving methodologies is its ability to:\n\nDistill Complex Problems: TRIZ helps in breaking down complex problems into their fundamental components, making them easier to analyze and solve.\nIdentify Contradictions: A key concept in TRIZ is the identification and resolution of contradictions within a system. This focus on contradictions often leads to breakthrough solutions.\nLeverage Patterns of Evolution: TRIZ recognizes that technical systems evolve according to certain patterns. Understanding these patterns allows for more accurate prediction and direction of future innovations.\n\n\n\n\nTo illustrate how TRIZ works in practice, consider the following example:\nProblem: A manufacturing company needs to increase the strength of a metal component without adding weight.\nTraditional Approach: Engineers might try different alloys or redesign the component through trial and error, which could be time-consuming and costly.\nTRIZ Approach: 1. Identify the contradiction: Increasing strength typically increases weight. 2. Consult the TRIZ Contradiction Matrix: This tool might suggest the principle of “Segmentation” or “Composite Materials.” 3. Apply the principle: The engineers might decide to use a composite material that combines lightweight and high-strength properties, or redesign the component with a honeycomb structure for strength without added weight.\nThis TRIZ-guided approach leads to innovative solutions more efficiently by leveraging proven problem-solving principles.\n\n\n\nWhile TRIZ originated in the field of engineering, its principles have been successfully applied to various domains, including:\n\nBusiness and management\nSoftware development\nEducation\nSocial issues\nEnvironmental challenges\n\nThis broad applicability demonstrates the versatility and power of TRIZ as a problem-solving and innovation tool.\nIn essence, TRIZ is not just a set of tools, but a way of thinking that encourages systematic innovation. It empowers problem solvers to tap into the collective knowledge of inventors across time and disciplines, offering a unique and powerful approach to tackling complex challenges in our rapidly evolving world."

    "text": "The history of TRIZ is intricately tied to the life and work of its founder, Genrich Altshuller, and the socio-political context of the Soviet Union in the mid-20th century. This section explores the origins of TRIZ, its development over time, and the key discoveries that shaped this innovative problem-solving methodology.\n\n\nTRIZ originated in 1946 when Genrich Altshuller, a young Soviet naval engineer and patent clerk, began his groundbreaking work on inventive problem solving. Born in 1926 in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, Altshuller showed an early aptitude for invention, receiving his first patent at the age of 14.\nKey events in the early development of TRIZ include:\n\n1946: While working in the patent office of the Caspian Sea flotilla, Altshuller noticed patterns in how inventive problems were solved across different fields. This observation sparked his lifelong quest to understand and systematize the inventive process.\n1948: Altshuller wrote a letter to Stalin, criticizing the state of invention in the Soviet Union and proposing a new approach. This led to his arrest and imprisonment in the Gulag until 1954.\n1956: Upon his release and rehabilitation, Altshuller published his first paper on TRIZ, introducing the concept of technical contradictions.\n\n\n\n\nCentral to the development of TRIZ was Altshuller’s extensive analysis of patent literature. Over several decades, Altshuller and his growing team of researchers examined over 200,000 patents from around the world. This monumental task aimed to distill the essence of inventive problem-solving, regardless of the specific field or technology involved.\nKey findings from the patent analysis:\n\nPatterns of Innovation: Despite the vast diversity of technologies and industries, many innovative solutions relied on a relatively small number of inventive principles.\nLevels of Invention: Altshuller classified inventions into five levels, ranging from routine design problems to pioneering inventions that create new fields of engineering.\n40 Inventive Principles: Through this analysis, Altshuller identified 40 fundamental principles that inventors used to solve problems and create innovations.\nContradiction Matrix: Altshuller developed a matrix to help inventors quickly identify which principles were most likely to resolve specific technical contradictions.\n\n\n\n\nThe development of TRIZ was not a one-time event but an ongoing process of refinement and expansion. Key milestones in its evolution include:\n\n1961: The first TRIZ seminar was held in Azerbaijan, marking the beginning of TRIZ as a teachable methodology.\n1969-1984: Altshuller developed ARIZ (Algorithm for Inventive Problem Solving), a step-by-step method for solving complex inventive problems. ARIZ went through several iterations, becoming increasingly sophisticated.\n1971: The first TRIZ school was established in Baku, Azerbaijan, formalizing the teaching of TRIZ.\n1970s-1980s: TRIZ continued to evolve with the addition of new tools and concepts, such as the Law of Ideality, the concept of physical contradictions, and the theory of technical system evolution.\n1989: The first international TRIZ conference was held in Petrozavodsk, Russia, marking the beginning of TRIZ’s global spread.\n\n\n\n\nThe collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s led to a rapid spread of TRIZ beyond its original borders:\n\n1990s: TRIZ began to gain recognition in the West, with companies like Procter & Gamble, Ford, and Boeing adopting TRIZ methodologies.\n1997: The Altshuller Institute for TRIZ Studies was founded in the United States, helping to promote TRIZ internationally.\n2000s-Present: TRIZ continues to evolve and adapt, with researchers and practitioners around the world developing new applications and integrating TRIZ with other methodologies like Six Sigma and Lean Manufacturing.\n\n\n\n\nAltshuller’s work on TRIZ has had a profound impact on the field of innovation and problem-solving:\n\nSystematic Approach to Innovation: TRIZ challenged the notion that innovation was purely a result of random inspiration, demonstrating that inventive problem-solving could be taught and learned.\nCross-Industry Application: By identifying universal principles of innovation, TRIZ enabled the transfer of solutions between seemingly unrelated fields.\nEducational Impact: TRIZ has been incorporated into engineering curricula at universities worldwide, shaping a new generation of innovative thinkers.\nCorporate Adoption: Many leading companies have adopted TRIZ as part of their innovation and problem-solving processes, demonstrating its practical value in real-world applications.\n\nThe historical development of TRIZ reflects a remarkable journey from one man’s insight to a globally recognized methodology for innovation. As TRIZ continues to evolve and adapt to new challenges, its core principles remain a testament to Altshuller’s vision of systematizing the creative process."

    "text": "TRIZ is built upon several fundamental concepts that form the foundation of its problem-solving methodology. Understanding these core concepts is crucial for effectively applying TRIZ in practice. This section explores the three primary concepts: Ideality, Contradictions, and Patterns of Evolution.\n\n\nThe concept of Ideality is central to TRIZ thinking and serves as a guiding principle for all problem-solving efforts.\n\n\nIdeality is expressed mathematically as:\nIdeality = (Sum of all Benefits) / (Sum of Costs + Sum of Harms)\nThis formula encapsulates the goal of any technical system or solution: to maximize benefits while minimizing costs and harmful effects.\n\n\n\n\nBenefits: All useful functions and outcomes of a system.\nCosts: All resources required to create and operate the system, including materials, energy, labor, and time.\nHarms: Any negative effects or undesired outcomes produced by the system.\n\n\n\n\nThe pursuit of Ideality drives innovation in TRIZ by encouraging:\n\nIncreasing Benefits: Finding ways to enhance the useful functions of a system.\nReducing Costs: Minimizing the resources required for a system to operate.\nEliminating Harms: Removing or mitigating any negative effects of the system.\n\n\n\n\nConsider the evolution of lighting technology:\n\nIncandescent Bulb: Low ideality due to high energy consumption (cost) and heat generation (harm) relative to light output (benefit).\nLED Light: Higher ideality with increased light output (benefit), lower energy consumption (reduced cost), and minimal heat generation (reduced harm).\n\nThe progression from incandescent to LED lighting demonstrates the pursuit of increased Ideality in technological evolution.\n\n\n\nAn extension of the Ideality concept is the Ideal Final Result (IFR), which represents the ultimate goal of a system where: - All benefits are achieved - No costs are incurred - No harm is produced\nWhile the IFR is often practically unattainable, it serves as a powerful thinking tool to guide innovation towards more ideal solutions.\n\n\n\n\nTRIZ posits that at the heart of many inventive problems lie contradictions. Resolving these contradictions often leads to innovative solutions.\n\n\nTRIZ identifies two main types of contradictions:\n\nTechnical Contradictions:\n\nDefinition: Improving one parameter of a system causes another parameter to worsen.\nExample: Increasing the strength of a material often increases its weight, which may be undesirable.\n\nPhysical Contradictions:\n\nDefinition: A single aspect of a system has conflicting requirements.\nExample: A coffee cup needs to be hot to keep the coffee warm but cool to hold comfortably.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRIZ provides several tools for resolving contradictions:\n\nContradiction Matrix: A tool that suggests inventive principles based on the specific technical contradiction being addressed.\nSeparation Principles: For physical contradictions, TRIZ suggests separating the conflicting requirements in space, time, or condition.\n40 Inventive Principles: A set of strategies derived from patent analysis that can be applied to resolve various types of contradictions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAircraft wing design presents a fundamental challenge in aeronautical engineering. An airplane wing must simultaneously fulfill two seemingly contradictory requirements:\n\nIt must be strong and stiff enough to withstand the tremendous forces experienced during flight, including lift, drag, and turbulence. This strength is crucial for maintaining structural integrity and ensuring flight stability and safety.\nIt should also be capable of adapting its shape to optimize aerodynamics across various flight conditions. This adaptability can significantly improve fuel efficiency by reducing drag and allowing the wing to perform optimally during different phases of flight (takeoff, cruising, landing).\n\nThe challenge lies in reconciling these opposing needs without compromising either aspect.\n\n\n\nTRIZ identifies this as a technical contradiction:\n\nImproving Parameter: #14 Strength\n“The extent to which the object is able to resist changing in response to force. Resistance to breaking.”\nWorsening Parameter: #35 Adaptability or versatility\n“The extent to which a system/object positively responds to external changes. Also, a system that can be used in multiple ways under a variety of circumstances.”\n\nThis contradiction encapsulates the core challenge: as we increase the wing’s strength, we typically decrease its adaptability, and vice versa.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis principle suggests making an object adjustable or adaptive to optimize its performance under different conditions.\n\nVariable Geometry Wing: Design a wing that can change its shape during flight. This could involve adjustable sweep angles, extendable surfaces, or morphing wing sections. For example, the wing could extend its surface area for takeoff and landing (when maximum lift is needed) and retract for high-speed cruising (to reduce drag).\nAdjustable Internal Supports: Implement a system of dynamic internal struts or supports that can alter the wing’s stiffness in real-time. These could be pneumatic, hydraulic, or electromechanical systems that adjust based on flight data, stiffening the wing during high-load conditions and relaxing it for better efficiency during steady flight.\nShape-Memory Alloys: Incorporate materials like Nitinol (a nickel-titanium alloy) into the wing structure. These alloys can change their shape and properties in response to temperature changes or electrical stimulation, allowing the wing to adapt its form without complex mechanical systems.\n\n\n\n\nThis principle involves transitioning from a homogeneous structure or environment to one with diverse properties.\n\nGradient Properties: Design the wing with varying material properties along its span and chord. This could involve using different materials or changing the density, thickness, or composition of materials across the wing.\nDifferential Stiffness: Create a wing with a stiffer root section (where it connects to the fuselage) for strength and load-bearing, gradually transitioning to a more flexible tip. This mimics natural structures like tree branches or bird wings, which are stiffer at the base and more flexible at the extremities.\nStrategic Fiber Orientation: In composite materials, carefully design the orientation of reinforcing fibers. For example, align fibers longitudinally near the wing root for maximum stiffness, and orient them differently towards the wingtip to allow for more flexibility and twist.\n\n\n\n\nIn TRIZ, “color changes” is often interpreted more broadly as changing the properties or characteristics of a system.\n\nSmart Materials: Integrate materials like piezoelectric ceramics or electroactive polymers into the wing skin. These materials can change their shape or stiffness when an electric current is applied, allowing for precise, localized control of wing properties.\nPiezoelectric Actuation: Embed piezoelectric actuators throughout the wing structure. When activated by electric currents, these can induce small deformations in the wing shape, allowing for fine control of aerodynamic properties without large, heavy mechanical systems.\nMicro-Fluidic Networks: Develop a system of small channels within the wing structure that can be filled with fluids of different viscosities. By pumping these fluids, the wing’s rigidity and shape can be dynamically adjusted. This mimics how plants control their structure through hydraulic systems.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe proposed wing design integrates all three principles into a cohesive system:\n\nDynamic Structure: The wing utilizes variable geometry and shape-memory alloys to make large-scale adaptations to flight conditions. This allows for optimal performance during different flight phases, from takeoff to cruising to landing.\nOptimized Material Distribution: The wing’s internal structure is designed with varying properties along its length and chord. This ensures maximum strength where needed (like at the wing root) while allowing for flexibility and adaptability in other areas (like the wingtip).\nSmart Material Systems: Piezoelectric materials and micro-fluidic networks provide fine-grained control over the wing’s properties. These systems can make small, rapid adjustments to optimize aerodynamics in real-time, responding to changing atmospheric conditions or flight requirements.\n\nThis integrated solution aims to create a wing that is both strong and adaptable, capable of maintaining structural integrity under high loads while also optimizing its shape for maximum efficiency across a range of flight conditions. By leveraging advanced materials and innovative design concepts, this TRIZ-inspired solution potentially resolves the fundamental contradiction in wing design, offering improvements in both stability and fuel efficiency without compromising either aspect.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRIZ has identified that technical systems tend to evolve in predictable patterns, regardless of the specific industry or technology involved.\n\n\n\nIncreasing Ideality: Systems evolve towards increased Ideality over time.\nNon-Uniform Development of System Elements: Different parts of a system evolve at different rates, leading to new contradictions and opportunities for innovation.\nTransition from Macro to Micro Level: Systems tend to evolve from using macro-level working principles to micro-level ones (e.g., mechanical systems to electronic to molecular).\nIncreasing Dynamism and Controllability: Systems become more flexible, dynamic, and controllable over time.\nIncreasing Complexity followed by Simplification: Systems often become more complex as they evolve, then are simplified through integration and removal of redundant parts.\nMatching and Mismatching of Parts: The coordination (or lack thereof) between parts of a system drives evolution.\nTransition to the Super-system: Individual systems often evolve by merging with other systems or moving to a higher level.\nTransition to Micro-level and Use of Fields: There’s a trend towards miniaturization and increased use of various fields (electromagnetic, acoustic, etc.) in system operation.\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding these patterns allows TRIZ practitioners to: 1. Predict future developments in technical systems 2. Identify opportunities for innovation by determining where a system is in its evolutionary path 3. Guide research and development efforts towards the most promising directions\n\n\n\nConsider the evolution of data storage: 1. Paper records (macro level) 2. Magnetic tape (transition to fields) 3. Floppy disks (increasing dynamism) 4. Hard drives (increasing complexity) 5. Solid-state drives (simplification, transition to micro-level) 6. Cloud storage (transition to super-system)\nThis evolution demonstrates several TRIZ patterns, including the transition from macro to micro level, increasing dynamism, and the move towards super-systems.\nBy understanding and applying these core concepts of Ideality, Contradictions, and Patterns of Evolution, TRIZ practitioners can approach problem-solving and innovation with a powerful set of tools and perspectives, leading to more effective and creative solutions."

    "text": "In addition to its analytical tools, TRIZ offers several creativity tools designed to overcome psychological inertia and stimulate innovative thinking. These tools help practitioners break free from conventional thought patterns, visualize problems and solutions in new ways, and generate innovative ideas. Let’s explore these tools in detail:\n\n\nThe Ideal Final Result is a fundamental concept in TRIZ that encourages envisioning the perfect solution without constraints.\nHow it works: 1. Define the ultimate goal or function of the system. 2. Imagine this function being performed perfectly, without any mechanisms or costs. 3. Work backwards from this ideal to identify potential paths to achieve it.\nExample: For a car windshield wiper system, the IFR might be: “The windshield cleans itself instantaneously, without any mechanism or energy input.”\nBenefit: IFR helps break psychological inertia by forcing consideration of radical improvements rather than incremental ones.\n\n\n\nSmart Little People is a modeling technique that represents system elements as intelligent agents.\nHow it works: 1. Imagine the system or problem area filled with tiny, intelligent beings. 2. Assign these “people” roles that represent different parts or functions of the system. 3. Visualize how these smart little people interact to perform the system’s function or solve the problem.\nExample: In designing a better tire, imagine smart little people forming the rubber compound, gripping the road, and flexing to absorb shocks.\nBenefit: SLP provides a fresh perspective on system interactions and can reveal new approaches to problem-solving.\n\n\n\nThe Size-Time-Cost Operator is a tool for considering extreme variations in a system’s parameters.\nHow it works: Consider six extreme scenarios: 1. What if the size becomes zero? Or infinitely large? 2. What if the process time becomes zero? Or infinitely long? 3. What if the cost becomes zero? Or if cost is no object?\nExample: For improving a coffee maker, consider: “What if it were microscopic? What if it were as big as a house? What if it made coffee instantly? What if it took a year?”\nBenefit: STC helps generate radical ideas by pushing beyond normal boundaries of thinking.\n\n\n\nThe Nine-screen Diagram is a method for analyzing a system across different levels of complexity and time frames.\nHow it works: Create a 3x3 grid: - Columns represent past, present, and future. - Rows represent subsystem, system, and supersystem.\nExample: For a bicycle, consider: - Subsystem (e.g., wheels) in past, present, future - Bicycle system in past, present, future - Transportation supersystem in past, present, future\nBenefit: This tool provides a comprehensive view of the system’s evolution and context, often revealing new innovation opportunities.\n\n\n\nThis technique involves applying attributes of random objects to the problem at hand.\nHow it works: 1. Select a random object unrelated to your problem. 2. List its attributes. 3. Apply these attributes to your problem or system.\nExample: To innovate a new chair design, select a random object like “cloud.” Attributes might include “fluffy,” “changeable,” “floating.” Apply these to chair design.\nBenefit: This method generates unexpected combinations and ideas, pushing beyond conventional thinking.\n\n\n\nThis tool encourages considering problems and solutions across various time scales and levels of detail.\nHow it works: 1. Consider the problem at different time scales (e.g., microseconds to years). 2. Examine the system at different physical scales (e.g., atomic to global).\nExample: For improving data storage, consider storage needs from microseconds of processor cache to years of archival, and from individual bits to global data centers.\nBenefit: This approach can reveal overlooked aspects of the problem and potential solution areas.\n\n\n\nTRIZ emphasizes identifying and utilizing available resources in innovative ways.\nHow it works: 1. List all resources in and around the system (material, energy, information, time, space). 2. Consider how each resource could be used to solve the problem or improve the system.\nExample: In improving a refrigerator’s efficiency, consider using the heat generated by the compressor for other purposes, like warming a compartment for defrosting foods.\nBenefit: This tool promotes cost-effective, elegant solutions by making better use of existing resources.\n\n\n\nAFD is a reverse brainstorming technique used to identify and prevent potential failures.\nHow it works: 1. Instead of asking “How can we prevent failures?”, ask “How can we make this system fail?” 2. List all possible ways to cause failure. 3. Use this list to identify and address vulnerabilities.\nExample: For a new smartphone design, brainstorm all possible ways to make it fail (drop it, overheat it, expose to water, etc.), then design preventive measures.\nBenefit: AFD helps identify non-obvious failure modes and improve system reliability.\n\n\n\nThe application of TRIZ methodology offers numerous benefits:\n\nSystematic and Guaranteed Innovation: TRIZ provides a structured approach to innovation, increasing the likelihood of finding effective solutions.\nAccelerated Problem-Solving: By directing focus to the most promising solution areas, TRIZ can significantly speed up the problem-solving process.\nOvercoming Psychological Inertia: TRIZ tools help break free from conventional thinking patterns that often limit creative problem-solving.\nSimplifying Systems while Retaining Functionality: Techniques like Trimming allow for system optimization without loss of essential functions.\nAccessing Global Knowledge and Proven Solutions: TRIZ leverages solutions from across industries and disciplines, allowing for knowledge transfer.\nImproved Team Collaboration and Idea Sharing: TRIZ provides a common language and framework for teams to approach problems collaboratively.\n\n\n\n\nWhile TRIZ originated in engineering, its principles and tools have been successfully applied across various fields:\n\nBusiness and Management: For strategic planning, process improvement, and organizational innovation.\nEducation: In developing teaching methods and curricula, and fostering creative thinking in students.\nScientific Research: For hypothesis generation, experimental design, and problem framing in scientific inquiries.\nProduct Development: In all stages of product lifecycle, from concept generation to optimization and improvement.\nProcess Optimization: For enhancing efficiency and effectiveness in manufacturing and service processes.\nSoftware Development: In designing algorithms, user interfaces, and solving complex coding challenges.\nEnvironmental Issues: For developing sustainable technologies and solving ecological problems.\nSocial Innovation: In addressing complex societal challenges and developing social enterprises.\n\n\n\n\nTRIZ (Theory of Inventive Problem Solving) stands out among problem-solving methodologies in several significant ways. This section explores how TRIZ compares to other well-known problem-solving and innovation methods, highlighting its unique features and advantages.\n\n\nWhile many problem-solving methods focus on problem analysis or solution selection, TRIZ provides tools for the crucial stage of concept generation.\nComparison with Other Methods:\n\nSix Sigma: Primarily focuses on problem identification and process improvement, but lacks specific tools for innovative solution generation.\nDesign Thinking: Emphasizes understanding user needs and rapid prototyping, but relies more on intuitive creativity for solution generation.\nTRIZ: Offers specific tools like the 40 Inventive Principles and the Effects Database to systematically generate innovative concepts.\n\nExample: In developing a new packaging solution, Six Sigma might help identify inefficiencies in the current process, and Design Thinking might uncover user preferences, but TRIZ could generate novel concepts like “nested packaging” using principles such as “Nesting” (#7) from the 40 Inventive Principles.\n\n\n\nUnlike brainstorming, which relies on random associations, TRIZ offers a structured path to creative solutions.\nComparison with Other Methods:\n\nBrainstorming: Generates ideas through free association, which can be hit-or-miss and influenced by group dynamics.\nLateral Thinking: Encourages looking at problems from different perspectives but doesn’t provide a systematic framework for doing so.\nTRIZ: Provides structured tools like the Contradiction Matrix and ARIZ (Algorithm for Inventive Problem Solving) to guide the creative process systematically.\n\nExample: To improve battery life in a smartphone, brainstorming might yield incremental ideas like “bigger battery” or “more efficient chips.” TRIZ, using the Contradiction Matrix, might suggest the principle of “Segmentation” to create a modular battery system or “Another Dimension” to explore 3D battery architectures.\n\n\n\nTRIZ facilitates the application of solutions from one field to problems in another, fostering interdisciplinary innovation.\nComparison with Other Methods:\n\nBenchmarking: Typically limited to comparing within the same industry or similar processes.\nAnalogical Thinking: Encourages drawing parallels but doesn’t provide a systematic way to do so across diverse fields.\nTRIZ: Through tools like the Effects Database and Standard Solutions, TRIZ actively promotes cross-industry solution transfer.\n\nExample: When tackling the problem of reducing aircraft noise, TRIZ might suggest looking at how nature solves similar problems, leading to the development of owl-inspired serrated engine components, a solution that might not arise through traditional aviation industry benchmarking.\n\n\n\nTRIZ’s unique focus on identifying and resolving contradictions often leads to breakthrough solutions.\nComparison with Other Methods:\n\nTrade-off Analysis: Typically seeks to find an optimal balance between conflicting parameters.\nCompromise Solutions: Many methods aim to find a middle ground between conflicting requirements.\nTRIZ: Specifically aims to resolve contradictions without compromise, often leading to innovative solutions that satisfy seemingly incompatible requirements.\n\nExample: In developing a new tire, a trade-off analysis might seek a balance between grip and durability. TRIZ, using the Separation Principles, might suggest a solution where the tire changes its properties dynamically, providing high grip when needed and high durability at other times.\n\n\n\nThrough its Trends of Evolution, TRIZ offers insights into future technological developments.\nComparison with Other Methods:\n\nTrend Analysis: Often based on extrapolating current trends, which can miss disruptive innovations.\nScenario Planning: Creates multiple possible futures but doesn’t provide guidance on likely technological evolutions.\nTRIZ: Offers specific Trends of Technical Evolution that have been observed across various fields, providing a framework for predicting future developments.\n\nExample: In predicting the evolution of computer interfaces, trend analysis might suggest incremental improvements in touch screens. TRIZ’s Trends, such as “Transition to the Super-system” and “Increasing Degree of Substance-Field Interactions,” might point towards the development of brain-computer interfaces or ambient computing environments.\n\n\n\nTRIZ provides a comprehensive toolkit that addresses various aspects of the innovation process.\nComparison with Other Methods:\n\nLean: Focuses primarily on process efficiency and waste reduction.\nAgile: Emphasizes iterative development and flexibility but doesn’t provide specific innovation tools.\nTRIZ: Offers tools for problem analysis (e.g., Function Analysis), concept generation (e.g., 40 Principles), and future forecasting (Trends of Evolution), providing a more complete innovation toolkit.\n\nExample: In developing a new product, Lean might help optimize the production process, and Agile could guide the development cycle, but TRIZ could assist in all phases - from initial concept generation to predicting future product iterations.\n\n\n\nTRIZ emphasizes the identification and utilization of available resources, often leading to cost-effective and elegant solutions.\nComparison with Other Methods:\n\nValue Engineering: Focuses on cost reduction while maintaining function, but doesn’t provide specific tools for identifying untapped resources.\nBlue Ocean Strategy: Seeks to create new market spaces but doesn’t specifically focus on resource utilization.\nTRIZ: Provides tools like the Resources Checklist and Substance-Field Analysis to systematically identify and utilize available resources in innovative ways.\n\nExample: In improving a water purification system, Value Engineering might focus on reducing component costs. TRIZ, through its resource-centric approach, might identify ways to use waste heat from the process to enhance purification efficiency, turning a “waste” into a valuable resource."

    "text": "TRIZ, viết tắt của cụm từ tiếng Nga “Teoriya Resheniya Izobretatelskikh Zadach,” có nghĩa là “Lý thuyết Giải quyết Vấn đề Sáng tạo” trong tiếng Anh. Được phát triển bởi Genrich Altshuller và các đồng nghiệp của ông tại Liên Xô cũ, TRIZ đã phát triển từ những năm 1940 trở thành một hệ thống toàn diện cho tư duy sáng tạo và đổi mới.\n\n\nCốt lõi của TRIZ là một công cụ giải quyết vấn đề, phân tích và dự báo, được rút ra từ việc nghiên cứu các mô hình sáng chế trong tài liệu bằng sáng chế toàn cầu. Không giống như các phương pháp giải quyết vấn đề truyền thống thường dựa vào thử và sai hoặc động não ngẫu nhiên, TRIZ cung cấp một cách tiếp cận có hệ thống cho sự đổi mới.\nCác khía cạnh chính của TRIZ như một công cụ giải quyết vấn đề bao gồm:\n\nĐổi mới có hệ thống: TRIZ thách thức quan niệm rằng đổi mới chỉ là kết quả của sự ngẫu hứng. Thay vào đó, nó cho rằng đổi mới tuân theo các mô hình và nguyên tắc nhất định có thể được xác định, học hỏi và áp dụng.\nKiến thức dựa trên bằng sáng chế: TRIZ được xây dựng dựa trên phân tích hàng trăm ngàn bằng sáng chế từ nhiều lĩnh vực khác nhau. Nghiên cứu sâu rộng này cho thấy rằng nhiều giải pháp sáng tạo trong các lĩnh vực khác nhau đều dựa vào một số ít nguyên tắc sáng tạo.\nGiải quyết vấn đề theo khái niệm: Thay vì cung cấp các giải pháp kỹ thuật cụ thể, TRIZ cung cấp các giải pháp khái niệm có thể thích ứng với nhiều lĩnh vực và vấn đề khác nhau. Điều này làm cho TRIZ trở thành một công cụ linh hoạt, có thể áp dụng trong nhiều ngành công nghiệp và lĩnh vực khác nhau.\n\n\n\n\nTRIZ là một bộ công cụ độc đáo, chặt chẽ và mạnh mẽ, hướng dẫn các kỹ sư hiểu và giải quyết các vấn đề của họ bằng cách tiếp cận kho báu kiến thức kỹ thuật và khoa học trong quá khứ. Nó mang lại nhiều lợi thế:\n\nTiếp cận kiến thức toàn cầu: TRIZ tóm lược kiến thức đổi mới của thế giới thành một bộ công cụ và nguyên tắc, cho phép các kỹ sư tiếp cận các giải pháp từ các lĩnh vực ngoài chuyên môn của họ.\nHiệu quả trong giải quyết vấn đề: Bằng cách cung cấp một cách tiếp cận có cấu trúc để đổi mới, TRIZ giúp các kỹ sư tìm ra các câu trả lời liên quan và thực tiễn cho các vấn đề thực tế một cách nhanh chóng và hiệu quả hơn so với các phương pháp truyền thống.\nVượt qua quán tính tâm lý: Các công cụ TRIZ được thiết kế để giúp các kỹ sư thoát khỏi các mô hình suy nghĩ thông thường, khuyến khích họ khám phá các giải pháp mới lạ mà họ có thể chưa từng nghĩ đến.\n\n\n\n\nĐiều làm cho TRIZ khác biệt so với các phương pháp giải quyết vấn đề khác là khả năng của nó trong việc:\n\nLàm rõ các vấn đề phức tạp: TRIZ giúp phá vỡ các vấn đề phức tạp thành các thành phần cơ bản, giúp dễ dàng phân tích và giải quyết hơn.\nXác định các mâu thuẫn: Một khái niệm chính trong TRIZ là xác định và giải quyết các mâu thuẫn trong một hệ thống. Sự tập trung vào các mâu thuẫn này thường dẫn đến các giải pháp đột phá.\nTận dụng các mô hình tiến hóa: TRIZ nhận ra rằng các hệ thống kỹ thuật phát triển theo các mô hình nhất định. Hiểu được các mô hình này cho phép dự đoán và hướng dẫn đổi mới tương lai chính xác hơn.\n\n\n\n\nĐể minh họa cách TRIZ hoạt động trong thực tiễn, hãy xem xét ví dụ sau:\nVấn đề: Một công ty sản xuất cần tăng cường độ bền của một bộ phận kim loại mà không làm tăng trọng lượng.\nCách tiếp cận truyền thống: Các kỹ sư có thể thử các hợp kim khác nhau hoặc thiết kế lại bộ phận thông qua thử và sai, điều này có thể tốn thời gian và chi phí.\nCách tiếp cận TRIZ: 1. Xác định mâu thuẫn: Tăng cường độ bền thường làm tăng trọng lượng. 2. Tham khảo Ma trận Mâu thuẫn của TRIZ: Công cụ này có thể đề xuất nguyên tắc “Phân đoạn” hoặc “Vật liệu tổng hợp.” 3. Áp dụng nguyên tắc: Các kỹ sư có thể quyết định sử dụng vật liệu tổng hợp kết hợp các thuộc tính nhẹ và độ bền cao, hoặc thiết kế lại bộ phận với cấu trúc tổ ong để có độ bền mà không tăng trọng lượng.\nCách tiếp cận theo hướng dẫn của TRIZ dẫn đến các giải pháp sáng tạo hiệu quả hơn bằng cách tận dụng các nguyên tắc giải quyết vấn đề đã được chứng minh.\n\n\n\nMặc dù TRIZ bắt nguồn từ lĩnh vực kỹ thuật, các nguyên tắc của nó đã được áp dụng thành công vào nhiều lĩnh vực khác nhau, bao gồm:\n\nKinh doanh và quản lý\nPhát triển phần mềm\nGiáo dục\nCác vấn đề xã hội\nThách thức môi trường\n\nSự ứng dụng rộng rãi này cho thấy tính linh hoạt và sức mạnh của TRIZ như một công cụ giải quyết vấn đề và đổi mới.\nVề bản chất, TRIZ không chỉ là một bộ công cụ, mà còn là một cách suy nghĩ khuyến khích sự đổi mới có hệ thống. Nó giúp những người giải quyết vấn đề tận dụng kiến thức tập thể của các nhà phát minh qua thời gian và các lĩnh vực khác nhau, mang lại một cách tiếp cận độc đáo và mạnh mẽ để giải quyết các thách thức phức tạp trong thế giới đang phát triển nhanh chóng của chúng ta.\n\n\n\n\nLịch sử của TRIZ gắn liền với cuộc đời và công việc của người sáng lập nó, Genrich Altshuller, và bối cảnh xã hội chính trị của Liên Xô vào giữa thế kỷ 20. Phần này khám phá nguồn gốc của TRIZ, sự phát triển của nó theo thời gian và những phát hiện chính đã hình thành phương pháp giải quyết vấn đề sáng tạo này.\n\n\nTRIZ ra đời vào năm 1946 khi Genrich Altshuller, một kỹ sư hải quân và nhân viên văn phòng bằng sáng chế trẻ tuổi người Liên Xô, bắt đầu công việc đột phá của mình về giải quyết vấn đề sáng tạo. Sinh năm 1926 tại Tashkent, Uzbekistan, Altshuller đã thể hiện tài năng sáng chế từ sớm, nhận được bằng sáng chế đầu tiên ở tuổi 14.\nCác sự kiện quan trọng trong giai đoạn đầu phát triển của TRIZ bao gồm:\n\n1946: Trong khi làm việc tại văn phòng bằng sáng chế của hạm đội Caspian, Altshuller nhận thấy các mẫu hình trong cách các vấn đề sáng chế được giải quyết qua các lĩnh vực khác nhau. Quan sát này đã khởi động hành trình suốt đời của ông nhằm hiểu và hệ thống hóa quy trình sáng tạo.\n1948: Altshuller đã viết một lá thư cho Stalin, chỉ trích tình trạng sáng chế ở Liên Xô và đề xuất một cách tiếp cận mới. Điều này đã dẫn đến việc ông bị bắt và giam giữ tại Gulag cho đến năm 1954.\n1956: Sau khi được thả và phục hồi danh dự, Altshuller đã xuất bản bài báo đầu tiên về TRIZ, giới thiệu khái niệm mâu thuẫn kỹ thuật.\n\n\n\n\nTrung tâm của sự phát triển TRIZ là phân tích sâu rộng về tài liệu bằng sáng chế của Altshuller. Trong nhiều thập kỷ, Altshuller và nhóm nghiên cứu ngày càng lớn mạnh của ông đã xem xét hơn 200.000 bằng sáng chế từ khắp nơi trên thế giới. Nhiệm vụ to lớn này nhằm mục đích rút ra bản chất của việc giải quyết vấn đề sáng tạo, bất kể lĩnh vực hoặc công nghệ cụ thể liên quan.\nCác phát hiện chính từ phân tích bằng sáng chế:\n\nMô hình đổi mới: Mặc dù có sự đa dạng lớn về công nghệ và ngành công nghiệp, nhiều giải pháp sáng tạo dựa trên một số nguyên tắc sáng tạo tương đối nhỏ.\nCấp độ của sáng chế: Altshuller phân loại các phát minh thành năm cấp\n\nđộ, từ các vấn đề thiết kế thông thường đến các phát minh tiên phong tạo ra các lĩnh vực kỹ thuật mới.\n\n40 Nguyên tắc Sáng tạo: Qua phân tích này, Altshuller đã xác định được 40 nguyên tắc cơ bản mà các nhà phát minh sử dụng để giải quyết các vấn đề và tạo ra sự đổi mới.\nMa trận Mâu thuẫn: Altshuller đã phát triển một ma trận để giúp các nhà phát minh nhanh chóng xác định những nguyên tắc nào có khả năng giải quyết các mâu thuẫn kỹ thuật cụ thể nhất.\n\n\n\n\nSự phát triển của TRIZ không phải là một sự kiện đơn lẻ mà là một quá trình liên tục của sự tinh chỉnh và mở rộng. Các mốc quan trọng trong sự phát triển của nó bao gồm:\n\n1961: Hội thảo TRIZ đầu tiên được tổ chức tại Azerbaijan, đánh dấu sự bắt đầu của TRIZ như một phương pháp có thể giảng dạy.\n1969-1984: Altshuller phát triển ARIZ (Thuật toán Giải quyết Vấn đề Sáng tạo), một phương pháp từng bước để giải quyết các vấn đề sáng tạo phức tạp. ARIZ đã trải qua nhiều phiên bản, ngày càng trở nên tinh vi.\n1971: Trường học TRIZ đầu tiên được thành lập tại Baku, Azerbaijan, chính thức hóa việc giảng dạy TRIZ.\nNhững năm 1970-1980: TRIZ tiếp tục phát triển với việc bổ sung các công cụ và khái niệm mới, chẳng hạn như Luật Lý tưởng, khái niệm về các mâu thuẫn vật lý và lý thuyết về sự tiến hóa của hệ thống kỹ thuật.\n1989: Hội nghị TRIZ quốc tế đầu tiên được tổ chức tại Petrozavodsk, Nga, đánh dấu sự bắt đầu của sự lan rộng toàn cầu của TRIZ.\n\n\n\n\nSự sụp đổ của Liên Xô vào đầu những năm 1990 đã dẫn đến sự lan rộng nhanh chóng của TRIZ ra ngoài biên giới ban đầu của nó:\n\nNhững năm 1990: TRIZ bắt đầu được công nhận ở phương Tây, với các công ty như Procter & Gamble, Ford và Boeing áp dụng các phương pháp TRIZ.\n1997: Viện Altshuller về Nghiên cứu TRIZ được thành lập tại Hoa Kỳ, giúp quảng bá TRIZ trên toàn thế giới.\nNhững năm 2000-Hiện tại: TRIZ tiếp tục phát triển và thích nghi, với các nhà nghiên cứu và thực hành trên khắp thế giới phát triển các ứng dụng mới và tích hợp TRIZ với các phương pháp khác như Six Sigma và Lean Manufacturing.\n\n\n\n\nCông việc của Altshuller về TRIZ đã có tác động sâu rộng đến lĩnh vực đổi mới và giải quyết vấn đề:\n\nPhương pháp tiếp cận có hệ thống để đổi mới: TRIZ thách thức quan niệm rằng đổi mới chỉ là kết quả của sự ngẫu hứng ngẫu nhiên, chứng minh rằng việc giải quyết vấn đề sáng tạo có thể được dạy và học.\nỨng dụng xuyên ngành: Bằng cách xác định các nguyên tắc đổi mới phổ quát, TRIZ đã cho phép chuyển giao các giải pháp giữa các lĩnh vực tưởng chừng không liên quan.\nTác động giáo dục: TRIZ đã được đưa vào chương trình giảng dạy kỹ thuật tại các trường đại học trên toàn thế giới, định hình một thế hệ mới của các nhà tư duy sáng tạo.\nÁp dụng trong doanh nghiệp: Nhiều công ty hàng đầu đã áp dụng TRIZ như một phần của quy trình đổi mới và giải quyết vấn đề của họ, chứng minh giá trị thực tiễn của nó trong các ứng dụng thực tế.\n\nSự phát triển lịch sử của TRIZ phản ánh một hành trình đáng chú ý từ sự thấu hiểu của một người đến một phương pháp được công nhận trên toàn cầu về đổi mới. Khi TRIZ tiếp tục phát triển và thích ứng với những thách thức mới, các nguyên tắc cốt lõi của nó vẫn là minh chứng cho tầm nhìn của Altshuller về việc hệ thống hóa quy trình sáng tạo.\n\n\n\n\nTRIZ được xây dựng trên một số khái niệm cơ bản hình thành nền tảng của phương pháp giải quyết vấn đề. Hiểu được những khái niệm cốt lõi này là rất quan trọng để áp dụng TRIZ một cách hiệu quả trong thực tế. Phần này khám phá ba khái niệm chính: Lý tưởng, Mâu thuẫn và Mô hình Tiến hóa.\n\n\nKhái niệm Lý tưởng là trung tâm của tư duy TRIZ và là nguyên tắc hướng dẫn cho tất cả các nỗ lực giải quyết vấn đề.\n\n\nLý tưởng được biểu thị bằng toán học như sau:\nLý tưởng = (Tổng tất cả các Lợi ích) / (Tổng Chi phí + Tổng Tác hại)\nCông thức này tóm tắt mục tiêu của bất kỳ hệ thống hoặc giải pháp kỹ thuật nào: tối đa hóa lợi ích đồng thời giảm thiểu chi phí và tác hại.\n\n\n\n\nLợi ích: Tất cả các chức năng và kết quả hữu ích của một hệ thống.\nChi phí: Tất cả các nguồn lực cần thiết để tạo và vận hành hệ thống, bao gồm vật liệu, năng lượng, lao động và thời gian.\nTác hại: Bất kỳ tác động tiêu cực hoặc kết quả không mong muốn nào do hệ thống tạo ra.\n\n\n\n\nViệc theo đuổi Lý tưởng thúc đẩy đổi mới trong TRIZ bằng cách khuyến khích:\n\nTăng Lợi ích: Tìm cách nâng cao các chức năng hữu ích của một hệ thống.\nGiảm Chi phí: Giảm thiểu các nguồn lực cần thiết để một hệ thống hoạt động.\nLoại bỏ Tác hại: Loại bỏ hoặc giảm thiểu bất kỳ tác động tiêu cực nào của hệ thống.\n\n\n\n\nHãy xem xét sự tiến hóa của công nghệ chiếu sáng:\n\nBóng đèn sợi đốt: Lý tưởng thấp do tiêu thụ năng lượng cao (chi phí) và sinh nhiệt (tác hại) so với ánh sáng phát ra (lợi ích).\nĐèn LED: Lý tưởng cao hơn với ánh sáng phát ra nhiều hơn (lợi ích), tiêu thụ năng lượng thấp hơn (giảm chi phí) và sinh nhiệt tối thiểu (giảm tác hại).\n\nSự tiến hóa từ bóng đèn sợi đốt sang đèn LED cho thấy sự theo đuổi tăng Lý tưởng trong sự tiến hóa công nghệ.\n\n\n\nMột mở rộng của khái niệm Lý tưởng là Kết quả Lý tưởng Cuối cùng (IFR), đại diện cho mục tiêu cuối cùng của một hệ thống nơi mà: - Tất cả các lợi ích đều đạt được - Không phát sinh chi phí - Không gây ra tác hại\nMặc dù IFR thường khó đạt được trong thực tế, nhưng nó là một công cụ tư duy mạnh mẽ để hướng dẫn sự đổi mới đến các giải pháp lý tưởng hơn.\n\n\n\n\nTRIZ cho rằng ở trung tâm của nhiều vấn đề sáng tạo là những mâu thuẫn. Việc giải quyết những mâu thuẫn này thường dẫn đến các giải pháp sáng tạo.\n\n\nTRIZ xác định hai loại mâu thuẫn chính:\n\nMâu thuẫn Kỹ thuật:\n\nĐịnh nghĩa: Cải thiện một tham số của hệ thống khiến một tham số khác trở nên xấu đi.\nVí dụ: Tăng cường độ bền của vật liệu thường làm tăng trọng lượng, điều này có thể không mong muốn.\n\nMâu thuẫn Vật lý:\n\nĐịnh nghĩa: Một khía cạnh của hệ thống có các yêu cầu mâu thuẫn nhau.\nVí dụ: Một chiếc cốc cà phê cần phải nóng để giữ ấm cà phê nhưng mát để cầm thoải mái.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRIZ cung cấp một số công cụ để giải quyết mâu thuẫn:\n\nMa trận Mâu thuẫn: Một công cụ đề xuất các nguyên tắc sáng tạo dựa trên mâu thuẫn kỹ thuật cụ thể đang được giải quyết.\nNguyên tắc Tách biệt: Đối với các mâu thuẫn vật lý, TRIZ đề xuất tách biệt các yêu cầu mâu thuẫn nhau về không gian, thời gian hoặc điều kiện.\n40 Nguyên tắc Sáng tạo: Một tập hợp các chiến lược rút ra từ phân tích bằng sáng chế có thể được áp dụng để giải quyết các loại\n\nmâu thuẫn khác nhau.\n\n\n\nVấn đề: Một chiếc máy bay cần có cánh chắc chắn và cứng (để ổn định) mà cũng có thể uốn cong (để tiết kiệm nhiên liệu).\nGiải pháp TRIZ: Áp dụng nguyên tắc “Phân đoạn” bằng cách thiết kế một cánh với cấu trúc ngoài linh hoạt và cấu trúc trong cứng cáp, giải quyết mâu thuẫn giữa độ cứng và tính linh hoạt.\n\n\n\n\nTRIZ đã xác định rằng các hệ thống kỹ thuật có xu hướng tiến hóa theo các mô hình dự đoán được, bất kể ngành công nghiệp hoặc công nghệ cụ thể.\n\n\n\nTăng cường Lý tưởng: Các hệ thống tiến hóa theo thời gian để tăng cường Lý tưởng.\nPhát triển không đồng đều của các yếu tố hệ thống: Các phần khác nhau của hệ thống tiến hóa với tốc độ khác nhau, dẫn đến các mâu thuẫn và cơ hội đổi mới mới.\nChuyển đổi từ cấp độ vĩ mô sang vi mô: Các hệ thống có xu hướng tiến hóa từ việc sử dụng các nguyên lý làm việc cấp độ vĩ mô sang vi mô (ví dụ: từ cơ học sang điện tử, đến mức độ phân tử).\nTăng cường tính linh hoạt và kiểm soát: Các hệ thống trở nên linh hoạt hơn, năng động và có khả năng kiểm soát cao hơn theo thời gian.\nTăng phức tạp, sau đó là đơn giản hóa: Các hệ thống thường trở nên phức tạp hơn khi chúng tiến hóa, sau đó được đơn giản hóa thông qua việc tích hợp và loại bỏ các phần dư thừa.\nSự tương hợp và không tương hợp của các phần: Sự phối hợp (hoặc thiếu phối hợp) giữa các phần của hệ thống thúc đẩy sự tiến hóa.\nChuyển đổi sang Siêu hệ thống: Các hệ thống cá nhân thường tiến hóa bằng cách hợp nhất với các hệ thống khác hoặc chuyển sang cấp độ cao hơn.\nChuyển đổi sang cấp độ vi mô và sử dụng các trường: Có xu hướng thu nhỏ hóa và tăng cường sử dụng các trường khác nhau (điện từ, âm thanh, v.v.) trong hoạt động của hệ thống.\n\n\n\n\nHiểu được các mô hình này cho phép các nhà thực hành TRIZ: 1. Dự đoán sự phát triển trong tương lai của các hệ thống kỹ thuật 2. Xác định các cơ hội đổi mới bằng cách xác định vị trí của hệ thống trên con đường tiến hóa của nó 3. Hướng dẫn các nỗ lực nghiên cứu và phát triển theo các hướng có tiềm năng nhất\n\n\n\nHãy xem xét sự tiến hóa của lưu trữ dữ liệu: 1. Hồ sơ giấy (cấp độ vĩ mô) 2. Băng từ (chuyển đổi sang các trường) 3. Đĩa mềm (tăng cường tính linh hoạt) 4. Ổ đĩa cứng (tăng cường phức tạp) 5. Ổ đĩa trạng thái rắn (đơn giản hóa, chuyển đổi sang cấp độ vi mô) 6. Lưu trữ đám mây (chuyển đổi sang Siêu hệ thống)\nSự tiến hóa này cho thấy một số mô hình TRIZ, bao gồm chuyển đổi từ cấp độ vĩ mô sang vi mô, tăng cường tính linh hoạt và chuyển đổi sang các siêu hệ thống.\nBằng cách hiểu và áp dụng các khái niệm cốt lõi này về Lý tưởng, Mâu thuẫn và Mô hình Tiến hóa, các nhà thực hành TRIZ có thể tiếp cận giải quyết vấn đề và đổi mới với một bộ công cụ và quan điểm mạnh mẽ, dẫn đến các giải pháp hiệu quả và sáng tạo hơn.\n\n\n\n\n\nPhương pháp TRIZ cung cấp một bộ công cụ và kỹ thuật toàn diện cho sự đổi mới có hệ thống và giải quyết vấn đề. Phần này khám phá các thành phần chính của Bộ công cụ TRIZ, ứng dụng của nó trong các lĩnh vực khác nhau, lợi ích của việc sử dụng TRIZ và quy trình học tập và áp dụng TRIZ.\n\n\nBộ công cụ TRIZ bao gồm một số công cụ mạnh mẽ, mỗi công cụ được thiết kế để giải quyết các khía cạnh cụ thể của quá trình giải quyết vấn đề:\n\n40 Nguyên tắc Sáng tạo: Đây là các chiến lược cơ bản để giải quyết các mâu thuẫn kỹ thuật, được rút ra từ việc phân tích các bằng sáng chế trong nhiều lĩnh vực.\nMa trận Mâu thuẫn: Một công cụ giúp xác định nguyên tắc nào trong số 40 Nguyên tắc Sáng tạo có khả năng giải quyết các mâu thuẫn kỹ thuật cụ thể nhất.\n76 Giải pháp Tiêu chuẩn: Một tập hợp các mô hình giải pháp cho các vấn đề hệ thống, đặc biệt hữu ích khi làm việc với các mô hình Trường-Chất.\n8 Xu hướng Tiến hóa Kỹ thuật: Các mô hình mô tả cách các hệ thống kỹ thuật có xu hướng tiến hóa theo thời gian, hữu ích để dự đoán các phát triển trong tương lai và xác định các cơ hội đổi mới.\nCơ sở Dữ liệu Hiệu ứng: Một bộ sưu tập các hiệu ứng vật lý, hóa học và hình học có thể được áp dụng để giải quyết các vấn đề kỹ thuật.\nPhân tích Chức năng và Phân tích Trường-Chất: Các công cụ để mô hình hóa và phân tích hệ thống về mặt chức năng và tương tác của chúng.\nKết quả Lý tưởng Cuối cùng (IFR): Một khái niệm khuyến khích suy nghĩ về giải pháp lý tưởng hóa cho một vấn đề.\nTài nguyên và Cắt gọn: Các kỹ thuật để xác định và sử dụng các tài nguyên có sẵn và đơn giản hóa hệ thống.\nARIZ (Thuật toán Giải quyết Vấn đề Sáng tạo): Một quy trình có cấu trúc để giải quyết các vấn đề sáng tạo phức tạp mà không thể giải quyết bằng các kỹ thuật TRIZ đơn giản hơn.\n\n\n\n\n\nNgoài các công cụ phân tích, TRIZ còn cung cấp một số công cụ sáng tạo được thiết kế để vượt qua quán tính tâm lý và kích thích tư duy đổi mới. Những công cụ này giúp các nhà thực hành phá vỡ các mẫu suy nghĩ thông thường, hình dung vấn đề và giải pháp theo những cách mới, và tạo ra những ý tưởng sáng tạo. Hãy cùng khám phá những công cụ này chi tiết hơn:\n\n\nKết quả Lý tưởng Cuối cùng là một khái niệm cơ bản trong TRIZ, khuyến khích hình dung giải pháp hoàn hảo mà không có ràng buộc.\nCách hoạt động: 1. Xác định mục tiêu cuối cùng hoặc chức năng của hệ thống. 2. Hãy tưởng tượng chức năng này được thực hiện một cách hoàn hảo, không cần cơ chế hoặc chi phí nào. 3. Làm việc ngược lại từ lý tưởng này để xác định các con đường tiềm năng để đạt được nó.\nVí dụ: Đối với hệ thống cần gạt kính ô tô, IFR có thể là: “Kính chắn gió tự làm sạch ngay lập tức, không cần cơ chế hoặc năng lượng đầu vào.”\nLợi ích: IFR giúp phá vỡ quán tính tâm lý bằng cách ép buộc xem xét những cải tiến triệt để thay vì những cải tiến gia tăng.\n\n\n\nNgười Nhỏ Thông Minh là một kỹ thuật mô hình hóa đại diện cho các yếu tố hệ thống như các tác nhân thông minh.\nCách hoạt động: 1. Hãy tưởng tượng hệ thống hoặc khu vực vấn đề đầy những người nhỏ bé thông minh. 2. Gán cho những “người” này những vai trò đại diện cho các phần hoặc chức năng khác nhau của hệ thống. 3. Hình dung cách những người nhỏ thông minh này tương tác để thực hiện chức năng của hệ thống hoặc giải quyết vấn đề.\nVí dụ: Trong việc thiết kế một chiếc lốp xe tốt hơn, hãy tưởng tượng những người nhỏ thông minh tạo thành hợp chất cao su, bám đường và uốn cong để hấp thụ các cú sốc.\nLợi ích: SLP cung cấp một góc nhìn mới về các tương tác hệ thống và có thể tiết lộ các cách tiếp cận mới để giải quyết vấn đề.\n\n\n\nNhà điều hành Kích thước-Thời gian-Chi phí là một công cụ để xem xét các biến thể cực đoan trong các tham số của hệ thống.\nCách hoạt động: H\nãy xem xét sáu kịch bản cực đoan: 1. Điều gì sẽ xảy ra nếu kích thước trở thành không? Hoặc cực kỳ lớn? 2. Điều gì sẽ xảy ra nếu thời gian quá trình trở thành không? Hoặc cực kỳ dài? 3. Điều gì sẽ xảy ra nếu chi phí trở thành không? Hoặc nếu chi phí không thành vấn đề?\nVí dụ: Để cải thiện máy pha cà phê, hãy cân nhắc: “Điều gì sẽ xảy ra nếu nó là vi mô? Điều gì sẽ xảy ra nếu nó lớn như một ngôi nhà? Điều gì sẽ xảy ra nếu nó pha cà phê ngay lập tức? Điều gì sẽ xảy ra nếu mất một năm?”\nLợi ích: STC giúp tạo ra các ý tưởng triệt để bằng cách đẩy xa hơn các giới hạn thông thường của tư duy.\n\n\n\nSơ đồ Chín màn hình là một phương pháp để phân tích hệ thống qua các cấp độ phức tạp và khung thời gian khác nhau.\nCách hoạt động: Tạo một lưới 3x3: - Các cột đại diện cho quá khứ, hiện tại và tương lai. - Các hàng đại diện cho hệ thống con, hệ thống và siêu hệ thống.\nVí dụ: Đối với một chiếc xe đạp, hãy cân nhắc: - Hệ thống con (ví dụ: bánh xe) trong quá khứ, hiện tại, tương lai - Hệ thống xe đạp trong quá khứ, hiện tại, tương lai - Siêu hệ thống vận tải trong quá khứ, hiện tại, tương lai\nLợi ích: Công cụ này cung cấp một cái nhìn toàn diện về sự tiến hóa và bối cảnh của hệ thống, thường tiết lộ các cơ hội đổi mới mới.\n\n\n\nKỹ thuật này bao gồm việc áp dụng các thuộc tính của các đối tượng ngẫu nhiên vào vấn đề hiện tại.\nCách hoạt động: 1. Chọn một đối tượng ngẫu nhiên không liên quan đến vấn đề của bạn. 2. Liệt kê các thuộc tính của nó. 3. Áp dụng các thuộc tính này vào vấn đề hoặc hệ thống của bạn.\nVí dụ: Để đổi mới một thiết kế ghế mới, hãy chọn một đối tượng ngẫu nhiên như “đám mây.” Các thuộc tính có thể bao gồm “mềm mại,” “thay đổi,” “nổi.” Áp dụng những điều này vào thiết kế ghế.\nLợi ích: Phương pháp này tạo ra các kết hợp và ý tưởng bất ngờ, vượt ra ngoài suy nghĩ thông thường.\n\n\n\nCông cụ này khuyến khích xem xét các vấn đề và giải pháp trên nhiều quy mô thời gian và mức độ chi tiết khác nhau.\nCách hoạt động: 1. Xem xét vấn đề ở các quy mô thời gian khác nhau (ví dụ: từ mili giây đến nhiều năm). 2. Kiểm tra hệ thống ở các quy mô vật lý khác nhau (ví dụ: từ cấp độ nguyên tử đến cấp độ toàn cầu).\nVí dụ: Để cải thiện lưu trữ dữ liệu, hãy xem xét nhu cầu lưu trữ từ mili giây của bộ nhớ đệm bộ xử lý đến nhiều năm lưu trữ, và từ các bit riêng lẻ đến các trung tâm dữ liệu toàn cầu.\nLợi ích: Cách tiếp cận này có thể tiết lộ các khía cạnh bị bỏ qua của vấn đề và các lĩnh vực giải pháp tiềm năng.\n\n\n\nTRIZ nhấn mạnh việc xác định và sử dụng tài nguyên có sẵn theo những cách sáng tạo.\nCách hoạt động: 1. Liệt kê tất cả các tài nguyên trong và xung quanh hệ thống (vật liệu, năng lượng, thông tin, thời gian, không gian). 2. Xem xét cách mỗi tài nguyên có thể được sử dụng để giải quyết vấn đề hoặc cải thiện hệ thống.\nVí dụ: Trong việc cải thiện hiệu quả của tủ lạnh, hãy xem xét việc sử dụng nhiệt sinh ra từ máy nén cho các mục đích khác, như làm ấm ngăn để rã đông thực phẩm.\nLợi ích: Công cụ này thúc đẩy các giải pháp tiết kiệm chi phí và thanh lịch bằng cách tận dụng tốt hơn các tài nguyên hiện có.\n\n\n\nAFD là một kỹ thuật động não ngược được sử dụng để xác định và ngăn ngừa các lỗi tiềm ẩn.\nCách hoạt động: 1. Thay vì hỏi “Làm thế nào chúng ta có thể ngăn ngừa lỗi?”, hãy hỏi “Làm thế nào chúng ta có thể khiến hệ thống này thất bại?” 2. Liệt kê tất cả các cách có thể gây ra thất bại. 3. Sử dụng danh sách này để xác định và khắc phục các điểm yếu.\nVí dụ: Đối với một thiết kế điện thoại thông minh mới, hãy động não tất cả các cách có thể gây ra thất bại (rơi, quá nóng, tiếp xúc với nước, v.v.), sau đó thiết kế các biện pháp phòng ngừa.\nLợi ích: AFD giúp xác định các chế độ lỗi không rõ ràng và cải thiện độ tin cậy của hệ thống.\n\n\n\nViệc áp dụng phương pháp TRIZ mang lại nhiều lợi ích:\n\nĐổi mới có hệ thống và đảm bảo: TRIZ cung cấp một cách tiếp cận có cấu trúc để đổi mới, tăng khả năng tìm ra các giải pháp hiệu quả.\nTăng tốc giải quyết vấn đề: Bằng cách tập trung vào các lĩnh vực giải pháp hứa hẹn nhất, TRIZ có thể đẩy nhanh quá trình giải quyết vấn đề đáng kể.\nVượt qua quán tính tâm lý: Các công cụ TRIZ giúp phá vỡ các mô hình tư duy thông thường thường giới hạn việc giải quyết vấn đề sáng tạo.\nĐơn giản hóa Hệ thống trong khi Duy trì Chức năng: Các kỹ thuật như Cắt gọn cho phép tối ưu hóa hệ thống mà không mất các chức năng thiết yếu.\nTiếp cận Kiến thức Toàn cầu và Giải pháp Đã được Chứng minh: TRIZ tận dụng các giải pháp từ các ngành và lĩnh vực khác nhau, cho phép chuyển giao kiến thức.\nCải thiện Hợp tác Nhóm và Chia sẻ Ý tưởng: TRIZ cung cấp một ngôn ngữ và khung chung để các nhóm tiếp cận vấn đề một cách hợp tác.\n\n\n\n\nMặc dù TRIZ bắt nguồn từ kỹ thuật, các nguyên tắc và công cụ của nó đã được áp dụng thành công trong nhiều lĩnh vực:\n\nKinh doanh và Quản lý: Đối với lập kế hoạch chiến lược, cải tiến quy trình và đổi mới tổ chức.\nGiáo dục: Trong việc phát triển phương pháp giảng dạy và chương trình học, và thúc đẩy tư duy sáng tạo ở sinh viên.\nNghiên cứu Khoa học: Đối với việc tạo ra giả thuyết, thiết kế thí nghiệm và đóng khung vấn đề trong các cuộc điều tra khoa học.\nPhát triển Sản phẩm: Trong tất cả các giai đoạn của vòng đời sản phẩm, từ tạo ra ý tưởng đến tối ưu hóa và cải tiến.\nTối ưu hóa Quy trình: Để nâng cao hiệu quả và hiệu quả trong sản xuất và quy trình dịch vụ.\nPhát triển Phần mềm: Trong việc thiết kế thuật toán, giao diện người dùng và giải quyết các thách thức mã hóa phức tạp.\nCác Vấn đề Môi trường: Để phát triển các công nghệ bền vững và giải quyết các vấn đề sinh thái.\nĐổi mới Xã hội: Trong việc giải quyết các thách thức xã hội phức tạp và phát triển các doanh nghiệp xã hội.\n\n\n\n\nTRIZ (Lý thuyết Giải quyết Vấn đề Sáng tạo) nổi bật trong số các phương pháp giải quyết vấn đề ở nhiều khía cạnh quan trọng. Phần này khám phá cách TRIZ so sánh với các phương pháp đổi mới và giải quyết vấn đề nổi tiếng khác, làm nổi bật các tính năng và lợi ích độc đáo của nó.\n\n\nTrong khi nhiều phương pháp giải quyết vấn đề tập trung vào phân tích vấn đề hoặc lựa chọn giải pháp, TRIZ cung cấp các công cụ cho giai đoạn quan trọng của việc tạo ra khái niệm.\nSo sánh với Các Phương pháp Khác:\n\nSix Sigma: Chủ yếu tập trung vào xác định vấn đề và cải thiện quy trình, nhưng thiếu các công cụ cụ thể để tạo ra giải pháp sáng tạo.\nDesign Thinking:\n\nNhấn mạnh vào việc hiểu nhu cầu của người dùng và tạo mẫu nhanh, nhưng phụ thuộc nhiều vào sự sáng tạo trực giác để tạo ra giải pháp.\n\nTRIZ: Cung cấp các công cụ cụ thể như 40 Nguyên tắc Sáng tạo và Cơ sở Dữ liệu Hiệu ứng để tạo ra các khái niệm sáng tạo một cách có hệ thống.\n\nVí dụ: Trong việc phát triển giải pháp đóng gói mới, Six Sigma có thể giúp xác định các điểm không hiệu quả trong quy trình hiện tại, và Design Thinking có thể phát hiện sở thích của người dùng, nhưng TRIZ có thể tạo ra các khái niệm mới như “đóng gói lồng nhau” bằng cách sử dụng các nguyên tắc như “Nesting” (#7) từ 40 Nguyên tắc Sáng tạo.\n\n\n\nKhông giống như động não, dựa vào các liên kết ngẫu nhiên, TRIZ cung cấp một con đường có cấu trúc để tạo ra các giải pháp sáng tạo.\nSo sánh với Các Phương pháp Khác:\n\nBrainstorming: Tạo ra ý tưởng thông qua liên kết tự do, có thể thành công hoặc thất bại và bị ảnh hưởng bởi động lực nhóm.\nLateral Thinking: Khuyến khích nhìn vào vấn đề từ các góc độ khác nhau nhưng không cung cấp một khung hệ thống để thực hiện điều này.\nTRIZ: Cung cấp các công cụ có cấu trúc như Ma trận Mâu thuẫn và ARIZ (Thuật toán Giải quyết Vấn đề Sáng tạo) để hướng dẫn quá trình sáng tạo một cách có hệ thống.\n\nVí dụ: Để cải thiện tuổi thọ pin của điện thoại thông minh, động não có thể đưa ra các ý tưởng gia tăng như “pin lớn hơn” hoặc “chip hiệu quả hơn”. TRIZ, sử dụng Ma trận Mâu thuẫn, có thể gợi ý nguyên tắc “Phân đoạn” để tạo ra hệ thống pin mô-đun hoặc “Kích thước Khác” để khám phá kiến trúc pin 3D.\n\n\n\nTRIZ tạo điều kiện áp dụng các giải pháp từ một lĩnh vực cho các vấn đề trong lĩnh vực khác, thúc đẩy sự đổi mới liên ngành.\nSo sánh với Các Phương pháp Khác:\n\nBenchmarking: Thường giới hạn trong việc so sánh trong cùng ngành hoặc các quy trình tương tự.\nAnalogical Thinking: Khuyến khích việc rút ra các điểm tương đồng nhưng không cung cấp một cách có hệ thống để thực hiện điều này qua các lĩnh vực khác nhau.\nTRIZ: Thông qua các công cụ như Cơ sở Dữ liệu Hiệu ứng và Giải pháp Tiêu chuẩn, TRIZ tích cực thúc đẩy việc chuyển giao giải pháp giữa các ngành.\n\nVí dụ: Khi giải quyết vấn đề giảm tiếng ồn máy bay, TRIZ có thể gợi ý việc nghiên cứu cách tự nhiên giải quyết các vấn đề tương tự, dẫn đến việc phát triển các thành phần động cơ có răng cưa lấy cảm hứng từ cú, một giải pháp có thể không xuất hiện thông qua đánh giá ngành hàng không truyền thống.\n\n\n\nTrọng tâm độc đáo của TRIZ là xác định và giải quyết các mâu thuẫn thường dẫn đến các giải pháp đột phá.\nSo sánh với Các Phương pháp Khác:\n\nTrade-off Analysis: Thường tìm cách tìm ra sự cân bằng tối ưu giữa các tham số mâu thuẫn.\nCompromise Solutions: Nhiều phương pháp nhằm tìm ra giải pháp trung gian giữa các yêu cầu mâu thuẫn.\nTRIZ: Cụ thể nhắm đến việc giải quyết các mâu thuẫn mà không cần phải thỏa hiệp, thường dẫn đến các giải pháp sáng tạo thỏa mãn các yêu cầu tưởng chừng không thể tương thích.\n\nVí dụ: Trong việc phát triển lốp xe mới, phân tích đánh đổi có thể tìm ra sự cân bằng giữa độ bám và độ bền. TRIZ, sử dụng các Nguyên tắc Tách biệt, có thể đề xuất một giải pháp trong đó lốp thay đổi các thuộc tính của nó một cách động, cung cấp độ bám cao khi cần thiết và độ bền cao ở các thời điểm khác.\n\n\n\nThông qua các Xu hướng Tiến hóa, TRIZ cung cấp cái nhìn sâu sắc về các phát triển công nghệ trong tương lai.\nSo sánh với Các Phương pháp Khác:\n\nTrend Analysis: Thường dựa vào việc ngoại suy các xu hướng hiện tại, có thể bỏ qua các đổi mới đột phá.\nScenario Planning: Tạo ra nhiều tương lai có thể xảy ra nhưng không cung cấp hướng dẫn về sự tiến hóa công nghệ có khả năng xảy ra.\nTRIZ: Cung cấp các Xu hướng Tiến hóa Kỹ thuật cụ thể đã được quan sát trong nhiều lĩnh vực, cung cấp một khung để dự đoán các phát triển trong tương lai.\n\nVí dụ: Trong việc dự đoán sự tiến hóa của giao diện máy tính, phân tích xu hướng có thể gợi ý các cải tiến gia tăng trong màn hình cảm ứng. Các Xu hướng của TRIZ, như “Chuyển đổi sang Siêu hệ thống” và “Tăng mức độ Tương tác Trường-Chất”, có thể chỉ ra sự phát triển của giao diện não-máy tính hoặc môi trường máy tính xung quanh.\n\n\n\nTRIZ cung cấp một bộ công cụ toàn diện giải quyết các khía cạnh khác nhau của quá trình đổi mới.\nSo sánh với Các Phương pháp Khác:\n\nLean: Chủ yếu tập trung vào hiệu quả quy trình và giảm lãng phí.\nAgile: Nhấn mạnh phát triển lặp lại và linh hoạt nhưng không cung cấp các công cụ đổi mới cụ thể.\nTRIZ: Cung cấp các công cụ để phân tích vấn đề (ví dụ: Phân tích Chức năng), tạo ra khái niệm (ví dụ: 40 Nguyên tắc), và dự báo tương lai (Xu hướng Tiến hóa), cung cấp một bộ công cụ đổi mới hoàn chỉnh hơn.\n\nVí dụ: Trong việc phát triển sản phẩm mới, Lean có thể giúp tối ưu hóa quy trình sản xuất, và Agile có thể hướng dẫn chu kỳ phát triển, nhưng TRIZ có thể hỗ trợ trong tất cả các giai đoạn - từ tạo ra khái niệm ban đầu đến dự đoán các sản phẩm lặp lại trong tương lai.\n\n\n\nTRIZ nhấn mạnh việc xác định và sử dụng các tài nguyên có sẵn, thường dẫn đến các giải pháp tiết kiệm chi phí và thanh lịch.\nSo sánh với Các Phương pháp Khác:\n\nValue Engineering: Tập trung vào giảm chi phí trong khi duy trì chức năng, nhưng không cung cấp các công cụ cụ thể để xác định các tài nguyên chưa được khai thác.\nBlue Ocean Strategy: Tìm cách tạo ra không gian thị trường mới nhưng không tập trung cụ thể vào việc sử dụng tài nguyên.\nTRIZ: Cung cấp các công cụ như Danh sách Kiểm tra Tài nguyên và Phân tích Trường-Chất để hệ thống hóa việc xác định và sử dụng các tài nguyên có sẵn theo cách sáng tạo.\n\nVí dụ: Trong việc cải thiện hệ thống lọc nước, Value Engineering có thể tập trung vào giảm chi phí linh kiện. TRIZ, thông qua cách tiếp cận tài nguyên-tập trung, có thể xác định cách sử dụng nhiệt thải từ quá trình để tăng hiệu quả lọc, biến “chất thải” thành tài nguyên có giá trị."

Được phát triển bởi Genrich Altshuller và các đồng nghiệp của ông tại Liên Xô cũ, TRIZ đã phát triển từ những năm 1940 trở thành một hệ thống toàn diện cho tư duy sáng tạo và đổi mới.\n\n\nCốt lõi của TRIZ là một công cụ giải quyết vấn đề, phân tích và dự báo, được rút ra từ việc nghiên cứu các mô hình sáng chế trong tài liệu bằng sáng chế toàn cầu. Không giống như các phương pháp giải quyết vấn đề truyền thống thường dựa vào thử và sai hoặc động não ngẫu nhiên, TRIZ cung cấp một cách tiếp cận có hệ thống cho sự đổi mới.\nCác khía cạnh chính của TRIZ như một công cụ giải quyết vấn đề bao gồm:\n\nĐổi mới có hệ thống: TRIZ thách thức quan niệm rằng đổi mới chỉ là kết quả của sự ngẫu hứng. Thay vào đó, nó cho rằng đổi mới tuân theo các mô hình và nguyên tắc nhất định có thể được xác định, học hỏi và áp dụng.\nKiến thức dựa trên bằng sáng chế: TRIZ được xây dựng dựa trên phân tích hàng trăm ngàn bằng sáng chế từ nhiều lĩnh vực khác nhau. Nghiên cứu sâu rộng này cho thấy rằng nhiều giải pháp sáng tạo trong các lĩnh vực khác nhau đều dựa vào một số ít nguyên tắc sáng tạo.\nGiải quyết vấn đề theo khái niệm: Thay vì cung cấp các giải pháp kỹ thuật cụ thể, TRIZ cung cấp các giải pháp khái niệm có thể thích ứng với nhiều lĩnh vực và vấn đề khác nhau. Điều này làm cho TRIZ trở thành một công cụ linh hoạt, có thể áp dụng trong nhiều ngành công nghiệp và lĩnh vực khác nhau.\n\n\n\n\nTRIZ là một bộ công cụ độc đáo, chặt chẽ và mạnh mẽ, hướng dẫn các kỹ sư hiểu và giải quyết các vấn đề của họ bằng cách tiếp cận kho báu kiến thức kỹ thuật và khoa học trong quá khứ. Nó mang lại nhiều lợi thế:\n\nTiếp cận kiến thức toàn cầu: TRIZ tóm lược kiến thức đổi mới của thế giới thành một bộ công cụ và nguyên tắc, cho phép các kỹ sư tiếp cận các giải pháp từ các lĩnh vực ngoài chuyên môn của họ.\nHiệu quả trong giải quyết vấn đề: Bằng cách cung cấp một cách tiếp cận có cấu trúc để đổi mới, TRIZ giúp các kỹ sư tìm ra các câu trả lời liên quan và thực tiễn cho các vấn đề thực tế một cách nhanh chóng và hiệu quả hơn so với các phương pháp truyền thống.\nVượt qua quán tính tâm lý: Các công cụ TRIZ được thiết kế để giúp các kỹ sư thoát khỏi các mô hình suy nghĩ thông thường, khuyến khích họ khám phá các giải pháp mới lạ mà họ có thể chưa từng nghĩ đến.\n\n\n\n\nĐiều làm cho TRIZ khác biệt so với các phương pháp giải quyết vấn đề khác là khả năng của nó trong việc:\n\nLàm rõ các vấn đề phức tạp: TRIZ giúp phá vỡ các vấn đề phức tạp thành các thành phần cơ bản, giúp dễ dàng phân tích và giải quyết hơn.\nXác định các mâu thuẫn: Một khái niệm chính trong TRIZ là xác định và giải quyết các mâu thuẫn trong một hệ thống. Sự tập trung vào các mâu thuẫn này thường dẫn đến các giải pháp đột phá.\nTận dụng các mô hình tiến hóa: TRIZ nhận ra rằng các hệ thống kỹ thuật phát triển theo các mô hình nhất định. Hiểu được các mô hình này cho phép dự đoán và hướng dẫn đổi mới tương lai chính xác hơn.\n\n\n\n\nĐể minh họa cách TRIZ hoạt động trong thực tiễn, hãy xem xét ví dụ sau:\nVấn đề: Một công ty sản xuất cần tăng cường độ bền của một bộ phận kim loại mà không làm tăng trọng lượng.\nCách tiếp cận truyền thống: Các kỹ sư có thể thử các hợp kim khác nhau hoặc thiết kế lại bộ phận thông qua thử và sai, điều này có thể tốn thời gian và chi phí.\nCách tiếp cận TRIZ: 1. Xác định mâu thuẫn: Tăng cường độ bền thường làm tăng trọng lượng. 2. Tham khảo Ma trận Mâu thuẫn của TRIZ: Công cụ này có thể đề xuất nguyên tắc “Phân đoạn” hoặc “Vật liệu tổng hợp.” 3. Áp dụng nguyên tắc: Các kỹ sư có thể quyết định sử dụng vật liệu tổng hợp kết hợp các thuộc tính nhẹ và độ bền cao, hoặc thiết kế lại bộ phận với cấu trúc tổ ong để có độ bền mà không tăng trọng lượng.\nCách tiếp cận theo hướng dẫn của TRIZ dẫn đến các giải pháp sáng tạo hiệu quả hơn bằng cách tận dụng các nguyên tắc giải quyết vấn đề đã được chứng minh.\n\n\n\nMặc dù TRIZ bắt nguồn từ lĩnh vực kỹ thuật, các nguyên tắc của nó đã được áp dụng thành công vào nhiều lĩnh vực khác nhau, bao gồm:\n\nKinh doanh và quản lý\nPhát triển phần mềm\nGiáo dục\nCác vấn đề xã hội\nThách thức môi trường\n\nSự ứng dụng rộng rãi này cho thấy tính linh hoạt và sức mạnh của TRIZ như một công cụ giải quyết vấn đề và đổi mới.\nVề bản chất, TRIZ không chỉ là một bộ công cụ, mà còn là một cách suy nghĩ khuyến khích sự đổi mới có hệ thống. Nó giúp những người giải quyết vấn đề tận dụng kiến thức tập thể của các nhà phát minh qua thời gian và các lĩnh vực khác nhau, mang lại một cách tiếp cận độc đáo và mạnh mẽ để giải quyết các thách thức phức tạp trong thế giới đang phát triển nhanh chóng của chúng ta."

    "text": "Lịch sử của TRIZ gắn liền với cuộc đời và công việc của người sáng lập nó, Genrich Altshuller, và bối cảnh xã hội chính trị của Liên Xô vào giữa thế kỷ 20. Phần này khám phá nguồn gốc của TRIZ, sự phát triển của nó theo thời gian và những phát hiện chính đã hình thành phương pháp giải quyết vấn đề sáng tạo này.\n\n\nTRIZ ra đời vào năm 1946 khi Genrich Altshuller, một kỹ sư hải quân và nhân viên văn phòng bằng sáng chế trẻ tuổi người Liên Xô, bắt đầu công việc đột phá của mình về giải quyết vấn đề sáng tạo. Sinh năm 1926 tại Tashkent, Uzbekistan, Altshuller đã thể hiện tài năng sáng chế từ sớm, nhận được bằng sáng chế đầu tiên ở tuổi 14.\nCác sự kiện quan trọng trong giai đoạn đầu phát triển của TRIZ bao gồm:\n\n1946: Trong khi làm việc tại văn phòng bằng sáng chế của hạm đội Caspian, Altshuller nhận thấy các mẫu hình trong cách các vấn đề sáng chế được giải quyết qua các lĩnh vực khác nhau. Quan sát này đã khởi động hành trình suốt đời của ông nhằm hiểu và hệ thống hóa quy trình sáng tạo.\n1948: Altshuller đã viết một lá thư cho Stalin, chỉ trích tình trạng sáng chế ở Liên Xô và đề xuất một cách tiếp cận mới. Điều này đã dẫn đến việc ông bị bắt và giam giữ tại Gulag cho đến năm 1954.\n1956: Sau khi được thả và phục hồi danh dự, Altshuller đã xuất bản bài báo đầu tiên về TRIZ, giới thiệu khái niệm mâu thuẫn kỹ thuật.\n\n\n\n\nTrung tâm của sự phát triển TRIZ là phân tích sâu rộng về tài liệu bằng sáng chế của Altshuller. Trong nhiều thập kỷ, Altshuller và nhóm nghiên cứu ngày càng lớn mạnh của ông đã xem xét hơn 200.000 bằng sáng chế từ khắp nơi trên thế giới. Nhiệm vụ to lớn này nhằm mục đích rút ra bản chất của việc giải quyết vấn đề sáng tạo, bất kể lĩnh vực hoặc công nghệ cụ thể liên quan.\nCác phát hiện chính từ phân tích bằng sáng chế:\n\nMô hình đổi mới: Mặc dù có sự đa dạng lớn về công nghệ và ngành công nghiệp, nhiều giải pháp sáng tạo dựa trên một số nguyên tắc sáng tạo tương đối nhỏ.\nCấp độ của sáng chế: Altshuller phân loại các phát minh thành năm cấp\n\nđộ, từ các vấn đề thiết kế thông thường đến các phát minh tiên phong tạo ra các lĩnh vực kỹ thuật mới.\n\n40 Nguyên tắc Sáng tạo: Qua phân tích này, Altshuller đã xác định được 40 nguyên tắc cơ bản mà các nhà phát minh sử dụng để giải quyết các vấn đề và tạo ra sự đổi mới.\nMa trận Mâu thuẫn: Altshuller đã phát triển một ma trận để giúp các nhà phát minh nhanh chóng xác định những nguyên tắc nào có khả năng giải quyết các mâu thuẫn kỹ thuật cụ thể nhất.\n\n\n\n\nSự phát triển của TRIZ không phải là một sự kiện đơn lẻ mà là một quá trình liên tục của sự tinh chỉnh và mở rộng. Các mốc quan trọng trong sự phát triển của nó bao gồm:\n\n1961: Hội thảo TRIZ đầu tiên được tổ chức tại Azerbaijan, đánh dấu sự bắt đầu của TRIZ như một phương pháp có thể giảng dạy.\n1969-1984: Altshuller phát triển ARIZ (Thuật toán Giải quyết Vấn đề Sáng tạo), một phương pháp từng bước để giải quyết các vấn đề sáng tạo phức tạp. ARIZ đã trải qua nhiều phiên bản, ngày càng trở nên tinh vi.\n1971: Trường học TRIZ đầu tiên được thành lập tại Baku, Azerbaijan, chính thức hóa việc giảng dạy TRIZ.\nNhững năm 1970-1980: TRIZ tiếp tục phát triển với việc bổ sung các công cụ và khái niệm mới, chẳng hạn như Luật Lý tưởng, khái niệm về các mâu thuẫn vật lý và lý thuyết về sự tiến hóa của hệ thống kỹ thuật.\n1989: Hội nghị TRIZ quốc tế đầu tiên được tổ chức tại Petrozavodsk, Nga, đánh dấu sự bắt đầu của sự lan rộng toàn cầu của TRIZ.\n\n\n\n\nSự sụp đổ của Liên Xô vào đầu những năm 1990 đã dẫn đến sự lan rộng nhanh chóng của TRIZ ra ngoài biên giới ban đầu của nó:\n\nNhững năm 1990: TRIZ bắt đầu được công nhận ở phương Tây, với các công ty như Procter & Gamble, Ford và Boeing áp dụng các phương pháp TRIZ.\n1997: Viện Altshuller về Nghiên cứu TRIZ được thành lập tại Hoa Kỳ, giúp quảng bá TRIZ trên toàn thế giới.\nNhững năm 2000-Hiện tại: TRIZ tiếp tục phát triển và thích nghi, với các nhà nghiên cứu và thực hành trên khắp thế giới phát triển các ứng dụng mới và tích hợp TRIZ với các phương pháp khác như Six Sigma và Lean Manufacturing.\n\n\n\n\nCông việc của Altshuller về TRIZ đã có tác động sâu rộng đến lĩnh vực đổi mới và giải quyết vấn đề:\n\nPhương pháp tiếp cận có hệ thống để đổi mới: TRIZ thách thức quan niệm rằng đổi mới chỉ là kết quả của sự ngẫu hứng ngẫu nhiên, chứng minh rằng việc giải quyết vấn đề sáng tạo có thể được dạy và học.\nỨng dụng xuyên ngành: Bằng cách xác định các nguyên tắc đổi mới phổ quát, TRIZ đã cho phép chuyển giao các giải pháp giữa các lĩnh vực tưởng chừng không liên quan.\nTác động giáo dục: TRIZ đã được đưa vào chương trình giảng dạy kỹ thuật tại các trường đại học trên toàn thế giới, định hình một thế hệ mới của các nhà tư duy sáng tạo.\nÁp dụng trong doanh nghiệp: Nhiều công ty hàng đầu đã áp dụng TRIZ như một phần của quy trình đổi mới và giải quyết vấn đề của họ, chứng minh giá trị thực tiễn của nó trong các ứng dụng thực tế.\n\nSự phát triển lịch sử của TRIZ phản ánh một hành trình đáng chú ý từ sự thấu hiểu của một người đến một phương pháp được công nhận trên toàn cầu về đổi mới. Khi TRIZ tiếp tục phát triển và thích ứng với những thách thức mới, các nguyên tắc cốt lõi của nó vẫn là minh chứng cho tầm nhìn của Altshuller về việc hệ thống hóa quy trình sáng tạo."

    "text": "TRIZ được xây dựng trên một số khái niệm cơ bản hình thành nền tảng của phương pháp giải quyết vấn đề. Hiểu được những khái niệm cốt lõi này là rất quan trọng để áp dụng TRIZ một cách hiệu quả trong thực tế. Phần này khám phá ba khái niệm chính: Lý tưởng, Mâu thuẫn và Mô hình Tiến hóa.\n\n\nKhái niệm Lý tưởng là trung tâm của tư duy TRIZ và là nguyên tắc hướng dẫn cho tất cả các nỗ lực giải quyết vấn đề.\n\n\nLý tưởng được biểu thị bằng toán học như sau:\nLý tưởng = (Tổng tất cả các Lợi ích) / (Tổng Chi phí + Tổng Tác hại)\nCông thức này tóm tắt mục tiêu của bất kỳ hệ thống hoặc giải pháp kỹ thuật nào: tối đa hóa lợi ích đồng thời giảm thiểu chi phí và tác hại.\n\n\n\n\nLợi ích: Tất cả các chức năng và kết quả hữu ích của một hệ thống.\nChi phí: Tất cả các nguồn lực cần thiết để tạo và vận hành hệ thống, bao gồm vật liệu, năng lượng, lao động và thời gian.\nTác hại: Bất kỳ tác động tiêu cực hoặc kết quả không mong muốn nào do hệ thống tạo ra.\n\n\n\n\nViệc theo đuổi Lý tưởng thúc đẩy đổi mới trong TRIZ bằng cách khuyến khích:\n\nTăng Lợi ích: Tìm cách nâng cao các chức năng hữu ích của một hệ thống.\nGiảm Chi phí: Giảm thiểu các nguồn lực cần thiết để một hệ thống hoạt động.\nLoại bỏ Tác hại: Loại bỏ hoặc giảm thiểu bất kỳ tác động tiêu cực nào của hệ thống.\n\n\n\n\nHãy xem xét sự tiến hóa của công nghệ chiếu sáng:\n\nBóng đèn sợi đốt: Lý tưởng thấp do tiêu thụ năng lượng cao (chi phí) và sinh nhiệt (tác hại) so với ánh sáng phát ra (lợi ích).\nĐèn LED: Lý tưởng cao hơn với ánh sáng phát ra nhiều hơn (lợi ích), tiêu thụ năng lượng thấp hơn (giảm chi phí) và sinh nhiệt tối thiểu (giảm tác hại).\n\nSự tiến hóa từ bóng đèn sợi đốt sang đèn LED cho thấy sự theo đuổi tăng Lý tưởng trong sự tiến hóa công nghệ.\n\n\n\nMột mở rộng của khái niệm Lý tưởng là Kết quả Lý tưởng Cuối cùng (IFR), đại diện cho mục tiêu cuối cùng của một hệ thống nơi mà: - Tất cả các lợi ích đều đạt được - Không phát sinh chi phí - Không gây ra tác hại\nMặc dù IFR thường khó đạt được trong thực tế, nhưng nó là một công cụ tư duy mạnh mẽ để hướng dẫn sự đổi mới đến các giải pháp lý tưởng hơn.\n\n\n\n\nTRIZ cho rằng ở trung tâm của nhiều vấn đề sáng tạo là những mâu thuẫn. Việc giải quyết những mâu thuẫn này thường dẫn đến các giải pháp sáng tạo.\n\n\nTRIZ xác định hai loại mâu thuẫn chính:\n\nMâu thuẫn Kỹ thuật:\n\nĐịnh nghĩa: Cải thiện một tham số của hệ thống khiến một tham số khác trở nên xấu đi.\nVí dụ: Tăng cường độ bền của vật liệu thường làm tăng trọng lượng, điều này có thể không mong muốn.\n\nMâu thuẫn Vật lý:\n\nĐịnh nghĩa: Một khía cạnh của hệ thống có các yêu cầu mâu thuẫn nhau.\nVí dụ: Một chiếc cốc cà phê cần phải nóng để giữ ấm cà phê nhưng mát để cầm thoải mái.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRIZ cung cấp một số công cụ để giải quyết mâu thuẫn:\n\nMa trận Mâu thuẫn: Một công cụ đề xuất các nguyên tắc sáng tạo dựa trên mâu thuẫn kỹ thuật cụ thể đang được giải quyết.\nNguyên tắc Tách biệt: Đối với các mâu thuẫn vật lý, TRIZ đề xuất tách biệt các yêu cầu mâu thuẫn nhau về không gian, thời gian hoặc điều kiện.\n40 Nguyên tắc Sáng tạo: Một tập hợp các chiến lược rút ra từ phân tích bằng sáng chế có thể được áp dụng để giải quyết các loại\n\nmâu thuẫn khác nhau.\n\n\n\nVấn đề: Một chiếc máy bay cần có cánh chắc chắn và cứng (để ổn định) mà cũng có thể uốn cong (để tiết kiệm nhiên liệu).\nGiải pháp TRIZ: Áp dụng nguyên tắc “Phân đoạn” bằng cách thiết kế một cánh với cấu trúc ngoài linh hoạt và cấu trúc trong cứng cáp, giải quyết mâu thuẫn giữa độ cứng và tính linh hoạt.\n\n\n\n\nTRIZ đã xác định rằng các hệ thống kỹ thuật có xu hướng tiến hóa theo các mô hình dự đoán được, bất kể ngành công nghiệp hoặc công nghệ cụ thể.\n\n\n\nTăng cường Lý tưởng: Các hệ thống tiến hóa theo thời gian để tăng cường Lý tưởng.\nPhát triển không đồng đều của các yếu tố hệ thống: Các phần khác nhau của hệ thống tiến hóa với tốc độ khác nhau, dẫn đến các mâu thuẫn và cơ hội đổi mới mới.\nChuyển đổi từ cấp độ vĩ mô sang vi mô: Các hệ thống có xu hướng tiến hóa từ việc sử dụng các nguyên lý làm việc cấp độ vĩ mô sang vi mô (ví dụ: từ cơ học sang điện tử, đến mức độ phân tử).\nTăng cường tính linh hoạt và kiểm soát: Các hệ thống trở nên linh hoạt hơn, năng động và có khả năng kiểm soát cao hơn theo thời gian.\nTăng phức tạp, sau đó là đơn giản hóa: Các hệ thống thường trở nên phức tạp hơn khi chúng tiến hóa, sau đó được đơn giản hóa thông qua việc tích hợp và loại bỏ các phần dư thừa.\nSự tương hợp và không tương hợp của các phần: Sự phối hợp (hoặc thiếu phối hợp) giữa các phần của hệ thống thúc đẩy sự tiến hóa.\nChuyển đổi sang Siêu hệ thống: Các hệ thống cá nhân thường tiến hóa bằng cách hợp nhất với các hệ thống khác hoặc chuyển sang cấp độ cao hơn.\nChuyển đổi sang cấp độ vi mô và sử dụng các trường: Có xu hướng thu nhỏ hóa và tăng cường sử dụng các trường khác nhau (điện từ, âm thanh, v.v.) trong hoạt động của hệ thống.\n\n\n\n\nHiểu được các mô hình này cho phép các nhà thực hành TRIZ: 1. Dự đoán sự phát triển trong tương lai của các hệ thống kỹ thuật 2. Xác định các cơ hội đổi mới bằng cách xác định vị trí của hệ thống trên con đường tiến hóa của nó 3. Hướng dẫn các nỗ lực nghiên cứu và phát triển theo các hướng có tiềm năng nhất\n\n\n\nHãy xem xét sự tiến hóa của lưu trữ dữ liệu: 1. Hồ sơ giấy (cấp độ vĩ mô) 2. Băng từ (chuyển đổi sang các trường) 3. Đĩa mềm (tăng cường tính linh hoạt) 4. Ổ đĩa cứng (tăng cường phức tạp) 5. Ổ đĩa trạng thái rắn (đơn giản hóa, chuyển đổi sang cấp độ vi mô) 6. Lưu trữ đám mây (chuyển đổi sang Siêu hệ thống)\nSự tiến hóa này cho thấy một số mô hình TRIZ, bao gồm chuyển đổi từ cấp độ vĩ mô sang vi mô, tăng cường tính linh hoạt và chuyển đổi sang các siêu hệ thống.\nBằng cách hiểu và áp dụng các khái niệm cốt lõi này về Lý tưởng, Mâu thuẫn và Mô hình Tiến hóa, các nhà thực hành TRIZ có thể tiếp cận giải quyết vấn đề và đổi mới với một bộ công cụ và quan điểm mạnh mẽ, dẫn đến các giải pháp hiệu quả và sáng tạo hơn."

    "text": "Ngoài các công cụ phân tích, TRIZ còn cung cấp một số công cụ sáng tạo được thiết kế để vượt qua quán tính tâm lý và kích thích tư duy đổi mới. Những công cụ này giúp các nhà thực hành phá vỡ các mẫu suy nghĩ thông thường, hình dung vấn đề và giải pháp theo những cách mới, và tạo ra những ý tưởng sáng tạo. Hãy cùng khám phá những công cụ này chi tiết hơn:\n\n\nKết quả Lý tưởng Cuối cùng là một khái niệm cơ bản trong TRIZ, khuyến khích hình dung giải pháp hoàn hảo mà không có ràng buộc.\nCách hoạt động: 1. Xác định mục tiêu cuối cùng hoặc chức năng của hệ thống. 2. Hãy tưởng tượng chức năng này được thực hiện một cách hoàn hảo, không cần cơ chế hoặc chi phí nào. 3. Làm việc ngược lại từ lý tưởng này để xác định các con đường tiềm năng để đạt được nó.\nVí dụ: Đối với hệ thống cần gạt kính ô tô, IFR có thể là: “Kính chắn gió tự làm sạch ngay lập tức, không cần cơ chế hoặc năng lượng đầu vào.”\nLợi ích: IFR giúp phá vỡ quán tính tâm lý bằng cách ép buộc xem xét những cải tiến triệt để thay vì những cải tiến gia tăng.\n\n\n\nNgười Nhỏ Thông Minh là một kỹ thuật mô hình hóa đại diện cho các yếu tố hệ thống như các tác nhân thông minh.\nCách hoạt động: 1. Hãy tưởng tượng hệ thống hoặc khu vực vấn đề đầy những người nhỏ bé thông minh. 2. Gán cho những “người” này những vai trò đại diện cho các phần hoặc chức năng khác nhau của hệ thống. 3. Hình dung cách những người nhỏ thông minh này tương tác để thực hiện chức năng của hệ thống hoặc giải quyết vấn đề.\nVí dụ: Trong việc thiết kế một chiếc lốp xe tốt hơn, hãy tưởng tượng những người nhỏ thông minh tạo thành hợp chất cao su, bám đường và uốn cong để hấp thụ các cú sốc.\nLợi ích: SLP cung cấp một góc nhìn mới về các tương tác hệ thống và có thể tiết lộ các cách tiếp cận mới để giải quyết vấn đề.\n\n\n\nNhà điều hành Kích thước-Thời gian-Chi phí là một công cụ để xem xét các biến thể cực đoan trong các tham số của hệ thống.\nCách hoạt động: H\nãy xem xét sáu kịch bản cực đoan: 1. Điều gì sẽ xảy ra nếu kích thước trở thành không? Hoặc cực kỳ lớn? 2. Điều gì sẽ xảy ra nếu thời gian quá trình trở thành không? Hoặc cực kỳ dài? 3. Điều gì sẽ xảy ra nếu chi phí trở thành không? Hoặc nếu chi phí không thành vấn đề?\nVí dụ: Để cải thiện máy pha cà phê, hãy cân nhắc: “Điều gì sẽ xảy ra nếu nó là vi mô? Điều gì sẽ xảy ra nếu nó lớn như một ngôi nhà? Điều gì sẽ xảy ra nếu nó pha cà phê ngay lập tức? Điều gì sẽ xảy ra nếu mất một năm?”\nLợi ích: STC giúp tạo ra các ý tưởng triệt để bằng cách đẩy xa hơn các giới hạn thông thường của tư duy.\n\n\n\nSơ đồ Chín màn hình là một phương pháp để phân tích hệ thống qua các cấp độ phức tạp và khung thời gian khác nhau.\nCách hoạt động: Tạo một lưới 3x3: - Các cột đại diện cho quá khứ, hiện tại và tương lai. - Các hàng đại diện cho hệ thống con, hệ thống và siêu hệ thống.\nVí dụ: Đối với một chiếc xe đạp, hãy cân nhắc: - Hệ thống con (ví dụ: bánh xe) trong quá khứ, hiện tại, tương lai - Hệ thống xe đạp trong quá khứ, hiện tại, tương lai - Siêu hệ thống vận tải trong quá khứ, hiện tại, tương lai\nLợi ích: Công cụ này cung cấp một cái nhìn toàn diện về sự tiến hóa và bối cảnh của hệ thống, thường tiết lộ các cơ hội đổi mới mới.\n\n\n\nKỹ thuật này bao gồm việc áp dụng các thuộc tính của các đối tượng ngẫu nhiên vào vấn đề hiện tại.\nCách hoạt động: 1. Chọn một đối tượng ngẫu nhiên không liên quan đến vấn đề của bạn. 2. Liệt kê các thuộc tính của nó. 3. Áp dụng các thuộc tính này vào vấn đề hoặc hệ thống của bạn.\nVí dụ: Để đổi mới một thiết kế ghế mới, hãy chọn một đối tượng ngẫu nhiên như “đám mây.” Các thuộc tính có thể bao gồm “mềm mại,” “thay đổi,” “nổi.” Áp dụng những điều này vào thiết kế ghế.\nLợi ích: Phương pháp này tạo ra các kết hợp và ý tưởng bất ngờ, vượt ra ngoài suy nghĩ thông thường.\n\n\n\nCông cụ này khuyến khích xem xét các vấn đề và giải pháp trên nhiều quy mô thời gian và mức độ chi tiết khác nhau.\nCách hoạt động: 1. Xem xét vấn đề ở các quy mô thời gian khác nhau (ví dụ: từ mili giây đến nhiều năm). 2. Kiểm tra hệ thống ở các quy mô vật lý khác nhau (ví dụ: từ cấp độ nguyên tử đến cấp độ toàn cầu).\nVí dụ: Để cải thiện lưu trữ dữ liệu, hãy xem xét nhu cầu lưu trữ từ mili giây của bộ nhớ đệm bộ xử lý đến nhiều năm lưu trữ, và từ các bit riêng lẻ đến các trung tâm dữ liệu toàn cầu.\nLợi ích: Cách tiếp cận này có thể tiết lộ các khía cạnh bị bỏ qua của vấn đề và các lĩnh vực giải pháp tiềm năng.\n\n\n\nTRIZ nhấn mạnh việc xác định và sử dụng tài nguyên có sẵn theo những cách sáng tạo.\nCách hoạt động: 1. Liệt kê tất cả các tài nguyên trong và xung quanh hệ thống (vật liệu, năng lượng, thông tin, thời gian, không gian). 2. Xem xét cách mỗi tài nguyên có thể được sử dụng để giải quyết vấn đề hoặc cải thiện hệ thống.\nVí dụ: Trong việc cải thiện hiệu quả của tủ lạnh, hãy xem xét việc sử dụng nhiệt sinh ra từ máy nén cho các mục đích khác, như làm ấm ngăn để rã đông thực phẩm.\nLợi ích: Công cụ này thúc đẩy các giải pháp tiết kiệm chi phí và thanh lịch bằng cách tận dụng tốt hơn các tài nguyên hiện có.\n\n\n\nAFD là một kỹ thuật động não ngược được sử dụng để xác định và ngăn ngừa các lỗi tiềm ẩn.\nCách hoạt động: 1. Thay vì hỏi “Làm thế nào chúng ta có thể ngăn ngừa lỗi?”, hãy hỏi “Làm thế nào chúng ta có thể khiến hệ thống này thất bại?” 2. Liệt kê tất cả các cách có thể gây ra thất bại. 3. Sử dụng danh sách này để xác định và khắc phục các điểm yếu.\nVí dụ: Đối với một thiết kế điện thoại thông minh mới, hãy động não tất cả các cách có thể gây ra thất bại (rơi, quá nóng, tiếp xúc với nước, v.v.), sau đó thiết kế các biện pháp phòng ngừa.\nLợi ích: AFD giúp xác định các chế độ lỗi không rõ ràng và cải thiện độ tin cậy của hệ thống.\n\n\n\nViệc áp dụng phương pháp TRIZ mang lại nhiều lợi ích:\n\nĐổi mới có hệ thống và đảm bảo: TRIZ cung cấp một cách tiếp cận có cấu trúc để đổi mới, tăng khả năng tìm ra các giải pháp hiệu quả.\nTăng tốc giải quyết vấn đề: Bằng cách tập trung vào các lĩnh vực giải pháp hứa hẹn nhất, TRIZ có thể đẩy nhanh quá trình giải quyết vấn đề đáng kể.\nVượt qua quán tính tâm lý: Các công cụ TRIZ giúp phá vỡ các mô hình tư duy thông thường thường giới hạn việc giải quyết vấn đề sáng tạo.\nĐơn giản hóa Hệ thống trong khi Duy trì Chức năng: Các kỹ thuật như Cắt gọn cho phép tối ưu hóa hệ thống mà không mất các chức năng thiết yếu.\nTiếp cận Kiến thức Toàn cầu và Giải pháp Đã được Chứng minh: TRIZ tận dụng các giải pháp từ các ngành và lĩnh vực khác nhau, cho phép chuyển giao kiến thức.\nCải thiện Hợp tác Nhóm và Chia sẻ Ý tưởng: TRIZ cung cấp một ngôn ngữ và khung chung để các nhóm tiếp cận vấn đề một cách hợp tác.\n\n\n\n\nMặc dù TRIZ bắt nguồn từ kỹ thuật, các nguyên tắc và công cụ của nó đã được áp dụng thành công trong nhiều lĩnh vực:\n\nKinh doanh và Quản lý: Đối với lập kế hoạch chiến lược, cải tiến quy trình và đổi mới tổ chức.\nGiáo dục: Trong việc phát triển phương pháp giảng dạy và chương trình học, và thúc đẩy tư duy sáng tạo ở sinh viên.\nNghiên cứu Khoa học: Đối với việc tạo ra giả thuyết, thiết kế thí nghiệm và đóng khung vấn đề trong các cuộc điều tra khoa học.\nPhát triển Sản phẩm: Trong tất cả các giai đoạn của vòng đời sản phẩm, từ tạo ra ý tưởng đến tối ưu hóa và cải tiến.\nTối ưu hóa Quy trình: Để nâng cao hiệu quả và hiệu quả trong sản xuất và quy trình dịch vụ.\nPhát triển Phần mềm: Trong việc thiết kế thuật toán, giao diện người dùng và giải quyết các thách thức mã hóa phức tạp.\nCác Vấn đề Môi trường: Để phát triển các công nghệ bền vững và giải quyết các vấn đề sinh thái.\nĐổi mới Xã hội: Trong việc giải quyết các thách thức xã hội phức tạp và phát triển các doanh nghiệp xã hội.\n\n\n\n\nTRIZ (Lý thuyết Giải quyết Vấn đề Sáng tạo) nổi bật trong số các phương pháp giải quyết vấn đề ở nhiều khía cạnh quan trọng. Phần này khám phá cách TRIZ so sánh với các phương pháp đổi mới và giải quyết vấn đề nổi tiếng khác, làm nổi bật các tính năng và lợi ích độc đáo của nó.\n\n\nTrong khi nhiều phương pháp giải quyết vấn đề tập trung vào phân tích vấn đề hoặc lựa chọn giải pháp, TRIZ cung cấp các công cụ cho giai đoạn quan trọng của việc tạo ra khái niệm.\nSo sánh với Các Phương pháp Khác:\n\nSix Sigma: Chủ yếu tập trung vào xác định vấn đề và cải thiện quy trình, nhưng thiếu các công cụ cụ thể để tạo ra giải pháp sáng tạo.\nDesign Thinking:\n\nNhấn mạnh vào việc hiểu nhu cầu của người dùng và tạo mẫu nhanh, nhưng phụ thuộc nhiều vào sự sáng tạo trực giác để tạo ra giải pháp.\n\nTRIZ: Cung cấp các công cụ cụ thể như 40 Nguyên tắc Sáng tạo và Cơ sở Dữ liệu Hiệu ứng để tạo ra các khái niệm sáng tạo một cách có hệ thống.\n\nVí dụ: Trong việc phát triển giải pháp đóng gói mới, Six Sigma có thể giúp xác định các điểm không hiệu quả trong quy trình hiện tại, và Design Thinking có thể phát hiện sở thích của người dùng, nhưng TRIZ có thể tạo ra các khái niệm mới như “đóng gói lồng nhau” bằng cách sử dụng các nguyên tắc như “Nesting” (#7) từ 40 Nguyên tắc Sáng tạo.\n\n\n\nKhông giống như động não, dựa vào các liên kết ngẫu nhiên, TRIZ cung cấp một con đường có cấu trúc để tạo ra các giải pháp sáng tạo.\nSo sánh với Các Phương pháp Khác:\n\nBrainstorming: Tạo ra ý tưởng thông qua liên kết tự do, có thể thành công hoặc thất bại và bị ảnh hưởng bởi động lực nhóm.\nLateral Thinking: Khuyến khích nhìn vào vấn đề từ các góc độ khác nhau nhưng không cung cấp một khung hệ thống để thực hiện điều này.\nTRIZ: Cung cấp các công cụ có cấu trúc như Ma trận Mâu thuẫn và ARIZ (Thuật toán Giải quyết Vấn đề Sáng tạo) để hướng dẫn quá trình sáng tạo một cách có hệ thống.\n\nVí dụ: Để cải thiện tuổi thọ pin của điện thoại thông minh, động não có thể đưa ra các ý tưởng gia tăng như “pin lớn hơn” hoặc “chip hiệu quả hơn”. TRIZ, sử dụng Ma trận Mâu thuẫn, có thể gợi ý nguyên tắc “Phân đoạn” để tạo ra hệ thống pin mô-đun hoặc “Kích thước Khác” để khám phá kiến trúc pin 3D.\n\n\n\nTRIZ tạo điều kiện áp dụng các giải pháp từ một lĩnh vực cho các vấn đề trong lĩnh vực khác, thúc đẩy sự đổi mới liên ngành.\nSo sánh với Các Phương pháp Khác:\n\nBenchmarking: Thường giới hạn trong việc so sánh trong cùng ngành hoặc các quy trình tương tự.\nAnalogical Thinking: Khuyến khích việc rút ra các điểm tương đồng nhưng không cung cấp một cách có hệ thống để thực hiện điều này qua các lĩnh vực khác nhau.\nTRIZ: Thông qua các công cụ như Cơ sở Dữ liệu Hiệu ứng và Giải pháp Tiêu chuẩn, TRIZ tích cực thúc đẩy việc chuyển giao giải pháp giữa các ngành.\n\nVí dụ: Khi giải quyết vấn đề giảm tiếng ồn máy bay, TRIZ có thể gợi ý việc nghiên cứu cách tự nhiên giải quyết các vấn đề tương tự, dẫn đến việc phát triển các thành phần động cơ có răng cưa lấy cảm hứng từ cú, một giải pháp có thể không xuất hiện thông qua đánh giá ngành hàng không truyền thống.\n\n\n\nTrọng tâm độc đáo của TRIZ là xác định và giải quyết các mâu thuẫn thường dẫn đến các giải pháp đột phá.\nSo sánh với Các Phương pháp Khác:\n\nTrade-off Analysis: Thường tìm cách tìm ra sự cân bằng tối ưu giữa các tham số mâu thuẫn.\nCompromise Solutions: Nhiều phương pháp nhằm tìm ra giải pháp trung gian giữa các yêu cầu mâu thuẫn.\nTRIZ: Cụ thể nhắm đến việc giải quyết các mâu thuẫn mà không cần phải thỏa hiệp, thường dẫn đến các giải pháp sáng tạo thỏa mãn các yêu cầu tưởng chừng không thể tương thích.\n\nVí dụ: Trong việc phát triển lốp xe mới, phân tích đánh đổi có thể tìm ra sự cân bằng giữa độ bám và độ bền. TRIZ, sử dụng các Nguyên tắc Tách biệt, có thể đề xuất một giải pháp trong đó lốp thay đổi các thuộc tính của nó một cách động, cung cấp độ bám cao khi cần thiết và độ bền cao ở các thời điểm khác.\n\n\n\nThông qua các Xu hướng Tiến hóa, TRIZ cung cấp cái nhìn sâu sắc về các phát triển công nghệ trong tương lai.\nSo sánh với Các Phương pháp Khác:\n\nTrend Analysis: Thường dựa vào việc ngoại suy các xu hướng hiện tại, có thể bỏ qua các đổi mới đột phá.\nScenario Planning: Tạo ra nhiều tương lai có thể xảy ra nhưng không cung cấp hướng dẫn về sự tiến hóa công nghệ có khả năng xảy ra.\nTRIZ: Cung cấp các Xu hướng Tiến hóa Kỹ thuật cụ thể đã được quan sát trong nhiều lĩnh vực, cung cấp một khung để dự đoán các phát triển trong tương lai.\n\nVí dụ: Trong việc dự đoán sự tiến hóa của giao diện máy tính, phân tích xu hướng có thể gợi ý các cải tiến gia tăng trong màn hình cảm ứng. Các Xu hướng của TRIZ, như “Chuyển đổi sang Siêu hệ thống” và “Tăng mức độ Tương tác Trường-Chất”, có thể chỉ ra sự phát triển của giao diện não-máy tính hoặc môi trường máy tính xung quanh.\n\n\n\nTRIZ cung cấp một bộ công cụ toàn diện giải quyết các khía cạnh khác nhau của quá trình đổi mới.\nSo sánh với Các Phương pháp Khác:\n\nLean: Chủ yếu tập trung vào hiệu quả quy trình và giảm lãng phí.\nAgile: Nhấn mạnh phát triển lặp lại và linh hoạt nhưng không cung cấp các công cụ đổi mới cụ thể.\nTRIZ: Cung cấp các công cụ để phân tích vấn đề (ví dụ: Phân tích Chức năng), tạo ra khái niệm (ví dụ: 40 Nguyên tắc), và dự báo tương lai (Xu hướng Tiến hóa), cung cấp một bộ công cụ đổi mới hoàn chỉnh hơn.\n\nVí dụ: Trong việc phát triển sản phẩm mới, Lean có thể giúp tối ưu hóa quy trình sản xuất, và Agile có thể hướng dẫn chu kỳ phát triển, nhưng TRIZ có thể hỗ trợ trong tất cả các giai đoạn - từ tạo ra khái niệm ban đầu đến dự đoán các sản phẩm lặp lại trong tương lai.\n\n\n\nTRIZ nhấn mạnh việc xác định và sử dụng các tài nguyên có sẵn, thường dẫn đến các giải pháp tiết kiệm chi phí và thanh lịch.\nSo sánh với Các Phương pháp Khác:\n\nValue Engineering: Tập trung vào giảm chi phí trong khi duy trì chức năng, nhưng không cung cấp các công cụ cụ thể để xác định các tài nguyên chưa được khai thác.\nBlue Ocean Strategy: Tìm cách tạo ra không gian thị trường mới nhưng không tập trung cụ thể vào việc sử dụng tài nguyên.\nTRIZ: Cung cấp các công cụ như Danh sách Kiểm tra Tài nguyên và Phân tích Trường-Chất để hệ thống hóa việc xác định và sử dụng các tài nguyên có sẵn theo cách sáng tạo.\n\nVí dụ: Trong việc cải thiện hệ thống lọc nước, Value Engineering có thể tập trung vào giảm chi phí linh kiện. TRIZ, thông qua cách tiếp cận tài nguyên-tập trung, có thể xác định cách sử dụng nhiệt thải từ quá trình để tăng hiệu quả lọc, biến “chất thải” thành tài nguyên có giá trị."

    "text": "Lời nói đầu cho ấn bản này\nHai năm đã trôi qua kể từ lần xuất bản đầu tiên của bản dịch này. Nhiều điều đã xảy ra với lý thuyết TRIZ. Nó đã phát triển nhanh chóng vượt ra ngoài ranh giới Nga ban đầu, vươn tới Hoa Kỳ, châu Âu, Ấn Độ, Trung Quốc, Đài Loan và nhiều nơi khác.\nMột số công ty với các nhà khoa học và chuyên gia TRIZ Nga đã bén rễ tại Hoa Kỳ, trở nên rất thành công trong việc áp dụng công nghệ TRIZ. Danh sách các công ty Mỹ cung cấp dịch vụ TRIZ được đặt ở Phụ lục 3.\nInvention Machine, Inc. (IM) từ Cambridge, Massachusetts, là công ty Nga đầu tiên quảng bá TRIZ tại Hoa Kỳ vào năm 1991. Ngày nay IM cung cấp phần mềm máy tính TRIZ và đào tạo. Họ cũng cung cấp dịch vụ TRIZ cho các công ty để giải quyết các vấn đề kỹ thuật.\nIdeation International, Inc. (III) có trụ sở tại Southfield, Michigan, là công ty Mỹ thứ hai được thành lập với các chuyên gia TRIZ Nga. III cung cấp đào tạo và tư vấn, và đã phát triển ba hệ thống giải pháp phần mềm dựa trên Windows.\nTechnical Innovation Center, Inc. (TIC), một công ty khác của Massachusetts, kết hợp với Center for Technology Commercialization, một công ty chuyển giao công nghệ của NASA, đã trở thành nguồn chính thứ ba cho tư vấn, đào tạo và xuất bản TRIZ.\nMột số chuyên gia TRIZ Nga - Victor Fey từ Detroit, Michigan và Zinovy Roysen từ Seattle, Washington - cũng đã thành lập các nhóm tư vấn TRIZ riêng của họ, cung cấp dịch vụ đào tạo và giải quyết vấn đề.\nCác công ty Mỹ đã bắt đầu đưa đào tạo TRIZ vào cho các kỹ sư. GOAL/QPC, có trụ sở tại Methuen, Massachusetts, và American Supplier Institute (ASI) có trụ sở tại Detroit là các tổ chức đào tạo tích cực quảng bá TRIZ. Vào tháng 11 năm 1995, hơn 200 người đã tham dự hội thảo TRIZ do ASI tài trợ tại Detroit. Hội thảo này khẳng định lại TRIZ như một công cụ quan trọng cho đổi mới có hệ thống.\nKể từ lần xuất bản đầu tiên của cuốn sách này, các tạp chí Machine Design và Industry Week đã xuất bản các bài báo về việc áp dụng thành công lý thuyết TRIZ trong các ngành công nghiệp Mỹ.\nCuối cùng, một kế hoạch thành lập Viện Sáng tạo Kỹ thuật Altshuller đã ra đời. Viện, dự kiến sẽ đặt tại Massachusetts, sẽ là trung tâm dịch thuật và phát triển nghiên cứu và xuất bản TRIZ. Hy vọng rằng Viện sẽ điều phối việc chứng nhận các chuyên gia và giảng viên TRIZ, và sẽ giúp phát triển chương trình giảng dạy để đưa TRIZ vào các tổ chức học thuật Mỹ. Nó cũng sẽ thúc đẩy nghiên cứu mới về TRIZ để tiếp tục phát triển ở phương Tây cũng như phát triển các ứng dụng mới trong các lĩnh vực kỹ thuật và phi kỹ thuật.\nCảm ơn Steven Rodman và Robyn Cutler vì công sức chỉnh sửa và thiết kế lại ấn bản mới này. Chúng tôi tin tưởng rằng cuốn sách này sẽ trở thành một lời giới thiệu về TRIZ được phổ biến rộng rãi hơn nữa trong thế giới phương Tây.\nLev Shulyak Worcester, Massachusetts Tháng 1, 1996"

    "text": "Lời nói đầu từ ấn bản gốc năm 1994\n“Mục đích duy nhất của tôi trong cuốn sách này là để chỉ ra rằng quá trình giải quyết các vấn đề kỹ thuật là điều mà bất kỳ ai cũng có thể tiếp cận được, quan trọng để học hỏi và rất dễ dàng để thực hiện.” H. Altov (Genrich Altshuller)\n“Mọi thứ nên được làm đơn giản nhất có thể, nhưng không đơn giản hơn thế.” Albert Einstein\nNgày nay, tiến bộ kỹ thuật đang thay đổi bộ mặt của Trái đất với tốc độ ngày càng tăng. Các nhà khoa học đang tìm cách học nhiều hơn trong thời gian ngắn hơn, để ghi nhớ nhiều hơn và lâu hơn, để làm mọi thứ nhanh hơn, và còn nhiều điều khác nữa. Điều này tạo ra nhu cầu to lớn về nguồn cung cấp ý tưởng và giải pháp mới không ngừng tăng lên. Hơn nữa, khối lượng kiến thức và việc áp dụng kiến thức này để giải quyết các vấn đề kỹ thuật đang mở rộng nhanh chóng. Làm thế nào chúng ta có thể quản lý tất cả thông tin mới này và khiến nó trở nên hữu ích?\nĐáng tiếc là một trong những niềm tin ăn sâu mà nhiều người có là tính sáng tạo là bẩm sinh và do đó không thể được dạy hay học. Nhưng chúng ta không nhất quán. Trong khi chúng ta chống lại hoặc bỏ qua việc dạy tính sáng tạo kỹ thuật, chúng ta lại có các khóa học âm nhạc và nghệ thuật - và các trường học nhận tất cả các loại học sinh, không chỉ những người cực kỳ tài năng hay nghệ thuật.\nVì vậy, chúng ta cũng cần các trường học và khóa học sẽ dạy chúng ta trở nên sáng tạo hơn hoặc đổi mới hơn và sẽ dạy chúng ta cách giải quyết các vấn đề kỹ thuật cũng như phi kỹ thuật một cách sáng tạo hơn. Chúng ta có thể làm điều này bằng cách cung cấp một lý thuyết mới để giải quyết các vấn đề kỹ thuật dựa trên kinh nghiệm của những người đã giải quyết các vấn đề thực tế. Lý thuyết này tồn tại và đã được sử dụng thành công bởi nhiều người ở nhiều quốc gia kể từ khi nó được Henry Altshuller của Liên Xô khởi xướng vào năm 1946. Hệ thống này đã lan rộng đến hơn 300 trường học, dạy cho nhiều người ở mọi lứa tuổi ở Liên Xô cũ, Phần Lan, Anh Quốc, Hungary và các nước khác.\nBằng chứng về tầm quan trọng của nó có thể được tìm thấy trong thực tế là vào năm 1978, sinh viên của Đại học Dnepropetrovsk và các trường đại học khác ở Liên Xô cũ được yêu cầu phải vượt qua một bài kiểm tra về Lý thuyết Giải quyết Vấn đề Kỹ thuật này.\nHọc sinh trẻ nhất của hệ thống là học sinh lớp năm và lớp sáu. Nó quá khó đối với trẻ em dưới các lớp này để học một lý thuyết, vì nó đòi hỏi một số kiến thức về vật lý để giải quyết các vấn đề đã cho.\nTác giả, Henry Altshuller, là chủ tịch Hiệp hội Nhà Sáng chế Nga. Năm 1984, ông đã xuất bản cuốn sách “Và Đột nhiên Nhà Sáng chế Xuất hiện” (Nghệ thuật Sáng chế) trong đó ông mô tả các phần cơ bản của lý thuyết của mình bằng ngôn ngữ đơn giản.\nNếu bạn là một nhà sáng chế hoặc một người thích giải quyết các vấn đề kỹ thuật thì đây là cuốn sách dành cho bạn.\nBạn sẽ học được các khái niệm cơ bản của Lý thuyết Giải quyết Vấn đề Sáng tạo (TRIZ trong viết tắt tiếng Nga). Bạn sẽ tìm thấy 78 vấn đề thực tế và 27 công cụ thực hành để giải quyết chúng trong cuốn sách này.\nĐây là cuốn sách thực hành đầu tiên cho những người ở Mỹ muốn thử sức trong đại dương sáng chế. Đây là lý do tại sao tôi quyết định dịch nó.\nTrong một số câu trả lời cho các vấn đề, tác giả đề cập đến các phát minh đã được “cấp bằng sáng chế” ở Liên Xô. Đây không phải là bằng sáng chế thực sự như chúng ta hiểu thuật ngữ này. Chúng là cái gọi là “Giấy chứng nhận tác giả” - bằng sáng chế chỉ có giá trị ở Liên Xô.\nTrong bản dịch, tôi đã cố gắng giữ lại hương vị của văn bản gốc. Đôi khi điều đó là không thể. Để thích ứng cuốn sách này với độc giả Mỹ, tôi đã phải thực hiện một số thay đổi. Ba phụ lục đã được thêm vào. Phụ lục đầu tiên có câu trả lời cho tất cả các vấn đề trong văn bản. Phụ lục thứ hai chứa tất cả các phương pháp và thủ thuật mà tác giả đã mô tả trong cuốn sách của mình để giải quyết những vấn đề đó. Phụ lục thứ ba giải thích một số yếu tố của lý thuyết của tác giả.\nKinh nghiệm đầu tiên của tôi trong việc học lý thuyết này diễn ra vào khoảng năm 1961. Tôi đang thiết kế một bộ chuyển đổi rất nhạy cảm và bị kẹt với một vấn đề không cho phép tôi đưa ra một công thức cuối cùng cho thiết kế. Sau đó, cuốn sách nhỏ đầu tiên của Henry Altshuller “Trở thành một Nhà Sáng chế” xuất hiện trên thị trường và cuốn sách này đã giúp tôi giải quyết vấn đề “không thể giải quyết” trong một thời gian ngắn. Kể từ đó, tôi đã được cấp bằng sáng chế cho hơn 20 phát minh - nhiều phát minh được phát triển nhờ lý thuyết này.\nNgày nay, Đại học Wayne State ở Detroit là tổ chức Mỹ đầu tiên cung cấp các khóa học dạy Lý thuyết Giải quyết Vấn đề Sáng tạo sử dụng khái niệm của Altshuller. Một số sản phẩm phần mềm máy tính dựa trên TRIZ hiện đã có sẵn bằng tiếng Anh.\nNhững người muốn hoàn thiện kiến thức của mình trong việc giải quyết vấn đề có thể làm như vậy thông qua các khóa học hiện có tại Trung tâm Đổi mới Kỹ thuật ở Worcester, Massachusetts.\nTôi tin chắc rằng bạn sẽ thích đọc cuốn sách này và tôi chúc bạn thành công.\nĐã đến lúc đất nước chúng ta lấy lại vị trí dẫn đầu trong thế giới kỹ thuật.\nLời cảm ơn đặc biệt của tôi đến Henry Altshuller, người đã cho phép tôi dịch cuốn sách của ông, đến Edith Morgan, Richard Langevin và Alexander Roghach - những biên tập viên của tôi - và đến vợ tôi vì sự kiên nhẫn và đánh giá cao của cô ấy về tầm quan trọng của công việc này.\nLev Shulyak\nDưới đây là bản dịch tiếng Việt của đoạn văn bản bạn yêu cầu:"

    "text": "Chương 1 Điều Không Thể\nLần đầu tiên tôi thấy một nhà phát minh là trước Thế chiến thứ hai. Chúng tôi sống ở Baku, nơi tôi là học sinh lớp bốn. Một ngày, trên đường về từ trường, tôi thấy một số thợ sửa chữa đang buồn bã hút thuốc bên cạnh một trạm biến áp điện bị hỏng. Họ đang nhìn vào một máy biến áp lớn màu đen đặt trên một nền gạch cao. Nền cao hơn một mét và máy biến áp trông như một tượng đài ấn tượng. Mọi người đang chờ một cần cẩu để đưa máy biến áp hỏng xuống và lắp đặt cái mới.\nSau đó, tôi làm bài tập về nhà dưới ánh đèn dầu. Chúng tôi không có điện tối hôm đó, cũng không có vào tối hôm sau, và cả tối thứ ba. Vào thời đó, cần cẩu được coi là thiết bị rất hiếm và quý giá, và việc có được một chiếc không phải là chuyện đơn giản. Các thợ điện phàn nàn về tình hình và không biết khi nào họ có thể hoàn thành công việc.\nTôi không nhận ra rằng một nhà phát minh sống ở Căn hộ số 11. Có tin đồn rằng người hàng xóm này, một kế toán viên, vào ngày hôm sau sẽ đưa máy biến áp xuống khỏi nền. Mỗi người thuê nhà trong tòa nhà của chúng tôi đều có biệt danh. Một số người được gọi rất tôn trọng như “Chú Kostya” hoặc “Chú Vlad” - nhưng người kế toán chỉ đơn giản là “Kế toán”.\nNgày hôm sau tôi bỏ tiết học cuối cùng vì tò mò muốn xem Kế toán sẽ hạ chiếc máy biến áp nặng đó như thế nào. Tôi đến đúng lúc. Tại lối vào sân sau của chúng tôi đứng một xe ngựa chở đầy đá. Công nhân đang dỡ đá và đặt nó bên cạnh nền của máy biến áp.\nTrước tiên tôi phải giải thích điều gì đó: Vào thời đó chúng tôi không có tủ lạnh điện. Mỗi ngày, từ mùa xuân đến mùa thu, một xe ngựa đi từ nhà này sang nhà khác phân phát những khối đá xanh. Các gia đình mua đá và đổ đầy vào các hộp gỗ. Đôi khi họ chỉ đổ đầy xô và nồi bằng đá.\nKhi công nhân mang các khối đá đến máy biến áp, Kế toán xếp chúng cạnh nền. Khi nền mới làm bằng đá đạt đến cùng độ cao với nền gạch, Kế toán đặt một tấm ván gỗ lên trên đá. Các công nhân sử dụng đòn bẩy, từ từ, centimet từng centimet, di chuyển máy biến áp từ nền gạch sang nền đá.\nĐá kêu lên tiếng kêu răng rắc. Tuy nhiên, vì các khối đá được đặt rất chính xác nên nền đông đá không bị đổ. Cuối cùng, Kế toán đích thân phủ đá bằng một miếng vải. Tất cả chúng tôi đứng và quan sát. Chẳng bao lâu sau, một dòng nước nhỏ xuất hiện trên mặt đất từ đá đang tan chảy. Ban đầu dòng chảy nhỏ. Sau đó nó ngày càng lớn hơn - vì mặt trời tháng Chín ở Baku vẫn mạnh như mùa hè.\nMọi người trong sân, thậm chí cả một ông già hay gây gổ với biệt danh “Kho báu” (ông ta chắc chắn rằng mình biết nơi cất giấu những kho báu lớn nhất nhưng có một vấn đề: Ông ta không có tiền để đến đó) đều nói rằng đá là một ý tưởng rất hay. Chú Michael - bây giờ mọi người gọi người kế toán bằng tên - ngồi trên ghế xếp đọc báo. Thỉnh thoảng ông mở một bên của tấm vải để nhìn vào đá đang tan chảy.\nSáng hôm sau tôi chạy ra sân. Máy biến áp đã hạ xuống được một nửa. Mặc dù là Chủ nhật nhưng các công nhân vẫn có mặt ở đó. Một dòng sông nước chảy từ dưới tấm vải che. Tôi bị sửng sốt. Mọi người đều biết đá tan chảy và tôi cũng biết điều đó. Không ai nghĩ ra rằng một máy biến áp có thể được di chuyển lên một khối đá - và đá sẽ hạ máy biến áp xuống đất. Làm sao Chú Michael và không ai khác nghĩ ra điều đó?\nTrước đây, đá chỉ là đá thông thường chỉ dùng để làm lạnh đồ vật. Nhưng bây giờ đá có thể thay thế một cần cẩu. Tại sao, đá có thể làm được những việc khác - và không chỉ là đá! Đột nhiên ý tưởng ấy đánh vào tôi rằng có lẽ bất cứ thứ gì cũng có thể được sử dụng cho các mục đích khác với mục đích mà nó được tạo ra.\nMột từ xuất hiện trong đầu tôi: Phát minh. Tôi nghĩ rằng Chú Michael đã tạo ra một phát minh và do đó ông đã trở thành một Nhà Phát minh. Có lẽ ai đó sẽ viết một bài báo về ông, đặc biệt nếu ông có thể tìm ra cách nâng một máy biến áp mới lên nền gạch.\nTuy nhiên vào thứ Hai, cần cẩu đã đến. Máy biến áp mới được đặt lên nền và cái cũ được mang đi. Các thợ điện kết nối máy biến áp mới, thợ mộc xây lại trạm và thợ sơn sơn nó. Công việc đã hoàn thành. Nhưng tôi sẽ luôn nhớ rằng trong bất kỳ hoàn cảnh nào, kể cả những trường hợp ‘vô vọng’, một giải pháp cho vấn đề có thể được tìm thấy. Điều gì đó có thể được phát minh và điều đó có thể rất đơn giản và đáng ngạc nhiên một cách tuyệt vời.\nTôi nhận được bằng sáng chế đầu tiên khi đang học lớp mười. Sau đó có những phát minh khác. Tôi làm việc tại văn phòng sáng chế và có cuộc gặp với các nhà phát minh khác nhau. Tôi ngày càng quan tâm hơn đến cơ chế sáng tạo: Làm thế nào để tạo ra các phát minh? Điều gì xảy ra trong đầu của nhà phát minh? Tại sao một giải pháp lại xuất hiện đột ngột?\nBạn có muốn trở thành một nhà phát minh không? Nếu vậy, hãy thử giải quyết vấn đề sau đây:\nDưới đây là bản dịch tiếng Việt của đoạn văn bản bạn yêu cầu:\nVấn đề 1 Phá vỡ hay không phá vỡ?\nMột lần nọ, giám đốc một nhà máy sản xuất bóng đèn điện triệu tập nhân viên kỹ thuật của mình để họp. Ông cho họ xem một bó thư. “Đây là những khiếu nại của khách hàng,” ông nói. “Họ không hài lòng với bóng đèn của chúng ta. Chúng ta phải tăng chất lượng sản phẩm. Tôi nghĩ có vấn đề với áp suất bên trong bóng đèn. Đôi khi áp suất cao hơn bình thường, đôi khi thấp hơn. Có ai nghĩ ra cách đo áp suất bên trong bóng đèn không?”\n“Rất đơn giản,” một kỹ sư nói. “Lấy bóng đèn, đập vỡ nó và…”\n“Đập vỡ nó ư?” giám đốc kêu lên.\n“Để kiểm tra chất lượng, chúng ta sẽ chỉ đập vỡ một bóng đèn trong số một trăm,” kỹ sư trả lời.\n“Chúng ta phải kiểm tra mọi bóng đèn,” giám đốc nói một cách tuyệt vọng. Ông quay sang các kỹ sư và nói, “Hãy suy nghĩ kỹ.”\nVà đột nhiên nhà phát minh xuất hiện.\n“Vấn đề này dành cho học sinh,” ông nói. “Mở sách giáo khoa…”\nVà ông giải thích nơi tìm thấy câu trả lời gần như hoàn chỉnh cho vấn đề này.\nBạn có thể đề xuất gì? Bạn có ý tưởng nào về cách đo áp suất bên trong bóng đèn không?\nSau vài giờ suy nghĩ, có thể lập một danh sách từ năm đến mười giải pháp cho vấn đề này. Thường thì những ý tưởng này rất yếu. Thường thì người ta đề nghị cân bóng đèn. Về lý thuyết, điều này có thể thực hiện được nếu bạn biết trọng lượng của bóng đèn rỗng và thể tích của bầu thủy tinh. Bạn có thể cân bóng đèn với khí và từ đó tính toán lượng khí.\nTrong thực tế, giải pháp này không khả thi. Có rất ít khí trong bóng đèn - một phần mười, hoặc thậm chí một phần nghìn gram. Cần một cân đặc biệt để đo loại trọng lượng này để đo các sai lệch so với mức bình thường. Sẽ mất rất nhiều thời gian để thực hiện các phép đo và tính toán này. Nó có thể tốt trong phòng thí nghiệm nhưng không phải trong nhà máy sản xuất.\nNgay cả một nhà phát minh có kinh nghiệm cũng sẽ không tìm ra giải pháp tối ưu ngay lập tức. Không hài lòng với một giải pháp, nhà phát minh sẽ tiếp tục phân tích ý tưởng này đến ý tưởng khác. Nhà phát minh sẽ suy nghĩ về vấn đề ngày đêm. Mọi thứ nhà phát minh thấy sẽ được sử dụng trong nỗ lực tinh thần để giải quyết vấn đề.\nNếu trời tuyết rơi, nhà phát minh nghĩ đến cái lạnh. Nếu chúng ta làm lạnh bóng đèn thì sao? Khí sẽ trở thành chất lỏng và sẽ dễ dàng đo thể tích của nó.\nMột chiếc xe buýt đầy người đi qua. Tiếng ồn, âm thanh… Nếu chúng ta sử dụng siêu âm thì sao? Tốc độ âm thanh phụ thuộc vào mật độ của khí.\nCó một trận bóng đá trên TV. Nếu đặt một quả bóng nhỏ trong bóng đèn thì sao? Tốc độ rơi của nó phụ thuộc vào mật độ của khí.\nVà cứ thế ngày qua ngày, tháng qua tháng, năm qua năm - đôi khi suốt cả cuộc đời. Đôi khi cuộc đời của nhà phát minh không đủ dài, và các nhà phát minh khác phải tiếp nhận vấn đề và tiếp tục tìm kiếm giải pháp. “Nếu chúng ta làm theo cách này thì sao?” nhà phát minh tiếp theo hỏi.\nThường xảy ra tình huống là khi đã đi được nửa chặng đường đến giải pháp, vấn đề bị gác lại với kết luận rằng nó không thể giải quyết được, rằng chúng ta không thể làm gì được. Bạn có thể tưởng tượng một nhà khoa học nói: “Để đạt được tốc độ vượt qua rào cản âm thanh, chúng ta phải nghiên cứu các vận động viên chạy và điền kinh. Một vận động viên chạy nước rút giỏi khác với một vận động viên kém ở điểm nào? Bí quyết của việc chạy nhanh là gì? Đây là những điều tôi cần biết.”\nCác vận động viên chạy đều khác nhau và quan trọng hơn là kết quả của một nghiên cứu như vậy không thể được sử dụng để xây dựng một máy bay siêu âm. Cần những nguyên tắc khác.\nPhương pháp thử và sai này có nguồn gốc từ thời cổ đại. Về bản chất, nó cũ như nhân loại. Mọi thứ thay đổi theo thời gian nhưng phương pháp thử và sai vẫn giữ nguyên. Một nhà khoa học nổi tiếng thời đại chúng ta, Giáo sư B. Ginsburg, đã nói: “Các phát minh của tôi là kết quả của việc sắp xếp các ý tưởng khác nhau.” Vào cuối thế kỷ 20, giáo sư tìm kiếm câu trả lời bằng cách sắp xếp các ý tưởng khác nhau! Điều này chính xác như cách nó đã được thực hiện hai nghìn, hai mươi nghìn, hai trăm nghìn năm trước.\nVì vậy chúng ta phải tìm kiếm một cách tốt hơn để giải quyết các vấn đề kỹ thuật.\nSự tiến hóa kỹ thuật có những đặc điểm và quy luật riêng của nó. Đó là lý do tại sao các nhà phát minh khác nhau ở các quốc gia khác nhau làm việc độc lập trên cùng một vấn đề kỹ thuật, lại đưa ra cùng một câu trả lời. Điều này có nghĩa là có những quy luật nhất định tồn tại. Nếu chúng ta có thể tìm ra những quy luật này, thì chúng ta có thể sử dụng chúng để giải quyết các vấn đề kỹ thuật - bằng quy tắc, bằng công thức, mà không lãng phí thời gian vào việc sắp xếp các phương án.\nTất nhiên, nhiều người hoài nghi chế giễu: “Ý anh là chúng ta có thể dạy mọi người phát minh ư!” Tôi đã nghiên cứu lý thuyết giải quyết vấn đề kỹ thuật không phải một năm, không phải hai năm, mà là cả đời. Ban đầu tôi làm việc một mình, sau đó những người khác tham gia. Thông qua nỗ lực của chúng tôi, một lý thuyết mới đã được phát triển. Sách đã được xuất bản, sách giáo khoa được viết, các vấn đề được phân loại, các hội thảo được bắt đầu và các trường học được mở. Hiện tại, kỹ thuật giải quyết vấn đề độc đáo này được giảng dạy tại hơn 300 trường học ở Nga.\nLý thuyết phát minh có thể được dạy ở bất kỳ độ tuổi nào - nhưng giống như trong thể thao, càng sớm càng tốt. Chúng tôi nhận thấy rằng các kỹ sư chuyên nghiệp là nhóm dễ dạy nhất lúc ban đầu. Bởi vì lý thuyết đang trong giai đoạn hình thành, kinh nghiệm giúp ích trong việc giải quyết vấn đề. Khi lý thuyết trở nên mạnh mẽ hơn, chúng tôi bắt đầu dạy các kỹ sư trẻ hơn, và sau đó là sinh viên. Sau đó chúng tôi mời học sinh trung học tham gia vào các nhóm đại học. Năm 1974, một tạp chí dành cho thanh thiếu niên bắt đầu xuất bản các vấn đề của nhà phát minh. Đó là những vấn đề kỹ thuật thực tế rất giống với vấn đề đo áp suất bên trong bóng đèn điện. Nhà xuất bản nhận được hàng nghìn lá thư với các giải pháp tiềm năng. Chúng tôi phân tích chúng, đưa ra nhận xét về những sai lầm điển hình, giải thích các phần nhỏ của lý thuyết, và xuất bản một vấn đề mới trong số tiếp theo.\nChúng tôi chưa thể dạy trẻ em ở mẫu giáo. Giới hạn của chúng tôi là học sinh lớp năm và lớp sáu. Để học lý thuyết phát minh, cần biết một chút về vật lý và hóa học, và điều này không được dạy ở mẫu giáo. Để vượt qua rào cản này, chúng ta cần đưa ra các vấn đề vui nhộn thay vì những vấn đề nghiêm túc.\nVí dụ, hãy tưởng tượng một căn phòng trống với chỉ một con búp bê nằm trên bậu cửa sổ và hai sợi dây thừng treo từ trần nhà. Nhiệm vụ của chúng ta là nối các đầu dưới của dây thừng. Cầm đầu của một sợi dây, một người không thể với tới đầu của sợi dây kia. Ai đó, hoặc cái gì đó, phải giúp đưa đầu của sợi dây thứ hai lại gần. Nhiệm vụ này dành cho một người và không có ai giúp đỡ.\nGiải pháp có thể được tìm ra bởi trẻ em không có kiến thức về vật lý. Sợi dây thứ hai phải được di chuyển - nhưng nó quá nhẹ. Nó cần có trọng lượng ở đầu dưới để tạo ra hiệu ứng con lắc. Con búp bê có thể là trọng lượng đó. Thế là xong. Vấn đề đã được giải quyết.\nVấn đề này có thể được làm cho khó hơn nếu chúng ta đặt hai quả bóng bay cùng với con búp bê trong phòng. Bóng bay không phải là trọng lượng tốt vì chúng quá nhẹ. Bóng bay sẽ thu hút sự chú ý của trẻ, và con búp bê sẽ không được xem xét trong một thời gian.\nChúng ta thậm chí có thể làm phức tạp hóa nhiệm vụ hơn nữa. Hãy lấy tất cả các vật thể ra khỏi phòng và xem liệu đứa trẻ có thể nghĩ ra cách sử dụng một chiếc giày làm trọng lượng hay không. Bạn có thể thấy rằng, một mặt, vấn đề này không phải là phát minh. Tuy nhiên, mặt khác, nó giống với một vấn đề phát minh. Chúng ta sẽ nói về những điểm tương đồng này sau. Bây giờ chúng ta chỉ có thể nói rằng không có rào cản nào ngăn cách những vấn đề này.\nDưới đây là bản dịch tiếng Việt của đoạn văn bản bạn yêu cầu:\nTrong cuốn sách này, chúng ta sẽ chỉ nói về sáng tạo kỹ thuật và tính phát minh. Tất nhiên, cuốn sách này không phải là một cuốn sách giáo khoa. Ý định duy nhất của tôi là để chỉ ra rằng quá trình giải quyết các vấn đề kỹ thuật là điều mà bất kỳ ai cũng có thể tiếp cận được, rằng quá trình này quan trọng cần phải học và rằng nó rất thú vị."

    "text": "Chương 2 Một số ví dụ đơn giản\nBất chấp những khó khăn, tôi sẽ cố gắng thuyết phục bạn rằng một số vấn đề sau đây thực sự là những phát minh và những giải pháp mà các nhà phát minh đã tìm ra được phân loại là phát minh. Bạn có thể giải quyết những vấn đề này ngay bây giờ mà không cần học lý thuyết. Bạn đã có đủ kiến thức và kinh nghiệm để làm việc với chúng.\nVấn đề 2 Có một “mánh khóe” liên quan\nĐó là sinh nhật của một cô gái trẻ. Một trong những vị khách mang đến một hộp kẹo sô-cô-la lớn. Những viên kẹo có hình dạng như những chai nhỏ đầy xi-rô mâm xôi đặc. Mọi người đều thích chúng. Một vị khách nói, “Tôi tự hỏi làm thế nào để làm ra những viên kẹo này?”\n“Trước tiên họ làm các chai và sau đó họ đổ đầy xi-rô vào!” một vị khách khác giải thích.\n“Xi-rô phải rất đặc, nếu không kẹo sẽ không đủ chắc,” vị khách thứ ba nói. “Đồng thời, sẽ rất khó để đổ xi-rô vào chai. Có thể làm ấm xi-rô để nó lỏng hơn. Vấn đề bây giờ là xi-rô sẽ làm tan chảy chai sô-cô-la. Chúng ta sẽ được về số lượng nhưng mất về chất lượng. Sẽ có nhiều kẹo bị lỗi.” Và đột nhiên Nhà Phát minh xuất hiện.\n“Tôi có một ý tưởng!” anh ta kêu lên. “Tôi biết cách làm loại kẹo này nhanh chóng và không có lỗi. Mánh khóe là…”\nAnh ta giải thích mọi thứ. Tất nhiên, kẹo có thể được sản xuất một cách đơn giản. Hãy suy nghĩ về nó. Nhà phát minh đã đề xuất điều gì?\nVấn đề này đã được đăng trên tạp chí thanh niên Komsomolskaya Pravda. Có hàng nghìn lá thư trả lời, và hầu như tất cả đều có câu trả lời đúng. Có lẽ bạn đã hiểu ra mánh khóe là gì: Xi-rô nên được đổ vào khuôn, đông lạnh và sau đó nhúng vào sô-cô-la nóng chảy. Xi-rô đông đá trong sô-cô-la ấm chính là phát minh. Điều này đã được thực hiện tại Viện Hóa học ở Estonia.\nCó một tạp chí khác gọi là Công báo Chính thức. Hàng nghìn phát minh được công bố trong tạp chí này cứ hai tuần một lần. Các mô tả về những phát minh này đôi khi rất dài dòng nhưng cuối cùng chứa đựng bản chất của phát minh. Trong bất kỳ số nào của tạp chí, ba đến năm phần trăm các phát minh có thể được phát triển bởi trẻ em trong độ tuổi đi học. Những phát minh này không đòi hỏi kiến thức đặc biệt về vật lý hoặc hóa học. Chúng là những phát minh nhỏ, tất nhiên, nhưng chúng là phát minh! Những ý tưởng này vừa mới vừa hữu ích.\nĐiều gì sẽ xảy ra nếu chúng ta cho trẻ em thậm chí chỉ một chút kiến thức?!\nVấn đề 3 Chúng ta nên chọn vị trí nào?\nCó một tháp cổ ở quảng trường trung tâm của một thị trấn. Một ngày nọ, người ta lo ngại rằng tháp đang bị nghiêng. Một ủy ban được thành lập để nghiên cứu xem tháp có thực sự đang nghiêng hay không. Tất cả thành viên của ủy ban đồng ý rằng để tiến hành đo đạc, họ cần tìm một điểm cố định - một điểm sẽ không di chuyển và có thể nhìn thấy từ tháp.\nCó thể chính quảng trường và các tòa nhà xung quanh cũng đang bị lún. Một công viên cách đó khoảng một nghìn năm trăm feet có một số bậc thang không bị lún. Tuy nhiên, bạn không thể nhìn thấy bậc thang công viên từ tháp vì các tòa nhà cao.\n“Một tình huống rất phức tạp,” chủ tịch ủy ban nói, suy ngẫm về câu hỏi, “Có lẽ chúng ta nên hỏi các nhà khoa học của chúng ta?”\nVà đột nhiên Nhà Phát minh xuất hiện.\n“Đừng làm phiền họ!” anh ta nói. “Hãy mở sách giáo khoa vật lý lớp sáu và bạn sẽ thấy rằng…”\nVà anh ta giải thích cần tìm gì. Bạn có ý tưởng nào không?\nCó lẽ bạn đã hiểu ra rồi. Nếu không, đừng thất vọng. Hãy mở một cuốn sách giáo khoa vật lý và tìm phần nói về thiết bị cân bằng nước.\nHãy lấy hai ống thủy tinh, đặt một cái trong tháp và cái kia trong công viên trên bậc thang. Nối chúng bằng một ống mềm và đổ đầy hệ thống bằng nước. Bởi vì đây là một thiết bị cân bằng nước, mực nước sẽ ở cùng một độ cao so với mực nước biển. Hãy đánh dấu các mức. Nếu tháp đang nghiêng, mực nước trong ống thủy tinh ở tháp cuối cùng sẽ dâng lên trên dấu ban đầu.\nMột phát minh rất thông minh và chỉ sử dụng kiến thức vật lý lớp sáu.\nHãy làm một bài toán phức tạp hơn.\nDưới đây là bản dịch tiếng Việt của đoạn văn bản bạn yêu cầu:\nVấn đề 4 “A” và “B” đang ngồi trên hàng rào\nTrong một phòng thí nghiệm hóa học, các kỹ sư đang xây dựng một máy để sản xuất phân bón mới. Hai thành phần lỏng sẽ được phân tán riêng biệt thành một sương mù mịn bởi máy này. Hãy gọi những chất lỏng này là “A” và “B”. Theo kế hoạch của các nhà hóa học, những giọt “A” được cho là sẽ di chuyển về phía những giọt “B”, tạo thành những giọt mới “AB”, tức là phân bón mới. Khi máy được bật lên, các giọt “A” tiếp xúc với các giọt “A” khác và tạo ra các giọt “AA”. Điều tương tự xảy ra với các giọt “B”. Nhưng các nhà hóa học không muốn có các giọt “AA” và “BB”.\n“Có lẽ chúng ta nên trộn chất lỏng”A” và “B” trước khi tạo ra các giọt,” một nhà hóa học nói.\n“Không, chúng ta không thể trộn chúng trước khi phân tán,” nhà hóa học khác nói. “Tôi không biết phải làm gì!”\nVà đột nhiên Nhà Phát minh xuất hiện.\n“Hãy lấy cuốn sách giáo khoa vật lý. Bạn sẽ tìm thấy quy luật mà bạn cần để giải quyết vấn đề này.”\nBạn nghĩ anh ta đang nói về quy luật nào?\nNếu bạn nhìn vào một cuốn sách vật lý, bạn có thể dễ dàng tìm thấy quy luật đơn giản này. Các hạt có cùng điện tích đẩy nhau và các hạt có điện tích khác nhau thì hút nhau. Hãy tích điện dương cho các giọt “A” và tích điện âm cho các giọt “B”. Khi hai luồng giọt gặp nhau, chúng ta sẽ chỉ có các giọt “AB”. Bạn có thể thấy rằng sự khéo léo cộng với một số kiến thức vật lý sẽ giúp giải quyết khoảng năm đến mười phần trăm các vấn đề phát minh thực tế. Điều gì sẽ xảy ra nếu ngoài ra chúng ta sử dụng một số kỹ thuật đặc biệt?\nMỗi nghề nghiệp đều có những quy tắc, kỹ thuật và thủ thuật riêng giúp làm công việc tốt hơn, nhanh hơn và dễ dàng hơn. Điều tương tự cũng đúng với việc giải quyết các vấn đề phát minh. Nhân tiện, chúng ta đã học được một số trong số đó.\nBạn có nhớ Vấn đề 2 với kẹo và xi-rô không? Nhà phát minh đã nói, “Mánh khóe là…” “Mánh khóe” là phương pháp, cách giải quyết vấn đề. Vấn đề với kẹo có hai mánh khóe. Thứ nhất là mọi người đều muốn làm ấm xi-rô. Tuy nhiên, Nhà Phát minh đề xuất hành động ngược lại - làm lạnh hoặc thậm chí đông lạnh nó. Mánh khóe thứ hai là biết rằng xi-rô đông lạnh sẽ tan chảy ở nhiệt độ phòng. Đối tượng đã thay đổi trạng thái tính chất vật lý của nó. Cùng một sự chuyển đổi đã xảy ra trong vấn đề mà Kế toán đã giải quyết. Đá tan chảy và máy biến áp từ từ hạ xuống.\nNhiều phương pháp dựa trên việc áp dụng các hiệu ứng và quy luật vật lý. Phương pháp khác với hiệu ứng và quy luật vật lý vì phương pháp nhằm giải quyết các vấn đề phát minh kỹ thuật. Quy luật vật lý nói rằng vật chất có thể được chuyển đổi từ trạng thái này sang trạng thái khác. Phương pháp chỉ ra rằng trong quá trình chuyển đổi như vậy, các tính chất vật lý của vật chất thay đổi đáng kể và những chuyển đổi này có thể được sử dụng để giải quyết nhiều vấn đề kỹ thuật cụ thể.\nĐây là hai phương pháp rất mạnh mẽ: Phương pháp #1: Làm ngược lại, và Phương pháp #2: Thay đổi trạng thái của tính chất vật lý.\nTrong bất kỳ số nào của Công báo Chính thức, chúng ta có thể tìm thấy các phát minh được tạo ra bằng cách sử dụng các phương pháp này. Ví dụ, Bằng sáng chế số 183122: “Phương pháp dỡ đường thô dạng hạt từ tàu chở dầu.” Để đẩy nhanh quá trình, đường được trộn với nước trước để làm cho nó thành chất lỏng và sau đó được bơm vào xi-lô lưu trữ. Đường lỏng sau đó được sấy khô trở lại thành đường hạt.\nMột ví dụ khác, Bằng sáng chế số 489938, là phương pháp khôi phục đặc tính chảy tự do của vật liệu rời trong kho. Nhà phát minh đề xuất đông lạnh nó thêm bằng nitơ lỏng thay vì phương pháp thông thường là làm nóng bằng hơi nước. Nitơ phá vỡ lớp băng giữa các hạt và sau đó bay hơi thành khí.\nNhà phát minh đã sử dụng hai phương pháp. Thứ nhất, Làm ngược lại - đông lạnh vật liệu thay vì làm nóng nó. Thứ hai, Thay đổi trạng thái của tính chất vật lý của nitơ. Nitơ ban đầu ở dạng lỏng và sau đó trở thành khí.\nBây giờ hãy thử một vấn đề mà bạn có thể tự giải quyết.\nVấn đề 5 Nó có thể tự biến mất\nTrong quá khứ, người ta sử dụng lọ mực không đổ. Nếu chúng ta đổ đầy cát vào lọ mực như vậy, làm thế nào chúng ta có thể loại bỏ cát khỏi lọ mực sau đó? Các kỹ sư đúc từng gặp một vấn đề tương tự. Các bộ phận kim loại rèn cần được làm sạch. Máy phun cát được sử dụng cho mục đích này. Cát làm sạch các bộ phận - và lọt vào các khoang. Bây giờ chúng ta phải loại bỏ cát khỏi các bộ phận. Khi các bộ phận lớn và nặng, rất bất tiện để lật chúng lên và lắc cát ra.\n“Có lẽ chúng ta có thể bằng cách nào đó che tất cả các lỗ,” một kỹ sư đề xuất. “Không, đó là quá nhiều công việc phụ. Tôi không thể thấy giải pháp. Cát không tự ra khỏi các khoang.”\nVà đột nhiên Nhà Phát minh xuất hiện.\n“Đúng vậy,” anh ta nói, “cát có thể tự biến mất. Điều chúng ta cần làm là tạo ra các hạt cát từ…”\nCác hạt cát nên được làm từ gì?\nLưu ý rằng tất cả các vấn đề trước đây thuộc về các lĩnh vực công nghệ khác nhau, nhưng các nhà phát minh đã sử dụng cùng một kỹ thuật để giải quyết chúng: Phương pháp #1: Làm ngược lại và Phương pháp #2: Thay đổi trạng thái của tính chất vật lý.\nĐây là một vấn đề nữa:\nVấn đề 6 Có một bằng sáng chế\nCần phải tạo ra nhiều lỗ đường kính 10mm trong một ống cao su. Không khó để đục hoặc khoan các lỗ, ngoại trừ việc ống rất linh hoạt. Nó kéo dãn, co lại và uốn cong. Vì vậy, việc tạo ra các lỗ một cách chính xác là một nhiệm vụ phức tạp. Người giám sát đã cố gắng đốt các lỗ bằng một thanh sắt nóng nhưng các cạnh của những lỗ này không đều và dễ vỡ.\n“Không thể làm gì được! Thật khó chịu!” người giám sát kêu lên, gần như khóc.\nVà đột nhiên Nhà Phát minh xuất hiện.\n“Đừng khóc!” anh ta nói. “Nó rất đơn giản! Có một Bằng sáng chế Anh số 1268562 trong đó nhà phát minh đề xuất…”\nBằng sáng chế đó có gì? Hãy suy nghĩ về nó.\nBạn đã làm quen với chỉ một vài phương pháp. Có khoảng một trăm phương pháp, một số đáng ngạc nhiên và khéo léo. Bạn sẽ đồng ý với tôi sau khi bạn giải quyết một vấn đề khác.\nVấn đề 7 Họ là những thám tử kiểu gì vậy?\nMột công ty mua dầu hướng dương. Việc giao hàng được thực hiện bằng xe bồn. Mỗi xe bồn có sức chứa 3000 lít. Người mua đột nhiên phát hiện ra rằng mỗi lần xe bồn được dỡ hàng, có sự thiếu hụt gần 30 lít. Người mua đã kiểm tra các thiết bị đo lường và tất cả đều hoạt động tốt. Anh ta kiểm tra các dấu niêm phong trên cửa hầm phía trên và sự rò rỉ của bồn chứa. Không có gì sai. Anh ta thậm chí đã xem xét lớp màng dầu mỏng trên các thành bên trong của bồn cũng như sự thay đổi trong nhiệt độ của dầu. Không có gì có thể giải thích được sự khác biệt.\nMột số thám tử có kinh nghiệm được yêu cầu điều tra vấn đề và họ không tìm thấy gì. Xe tải không bao giờ dừng lại trong quá trình giao hàng và tài xế không bao giờ đổ dầu ra khỏi bồn. Ngay cả các thám tử cũng bối rối.\nVà đột nhiên Nhà Phát minh xuất hiện.\n“Các anh là thám tử kiểu gì vậy?” anh ta hỏi. “Tất cả rất đơn giản. Chúng ta phải suy nghĩ một chút.” Rồi anh ta giải thích điều gì đang xảy ra.\nBạn nghĩ điều gì đang xảy ra?\nVấn đề này đã được đăng trên một tạp chí thanh niên. Nhà xuất bản nhận được hàng nghìn lá thư từ học sinh trường phổ thông và đại học, và thậm chí từ các kỹ sư. Tác giả của hai lá thư là cảnh sát. Có cả núi thư, nhưng không ai có câu trả lời đúng.\nCác thám tử có thể dễ dàng khám phá ra bí mật nếu họ biết một trong những thủ thuật của nhà phát minh: Nếu không thể làm ngay bây giờ, nó nên được làm trước.\nHóa ra tài xế đã treo một cái xô bên trong bồn khi nó còn trống. Nhà cung cấp đổ đầy dầu vào xe bồn. Đồng thời, xô cũng được đổ đầy. Xe tải đi đến địa điểm của người mua và được dỡ hàng. Xô đầy dầu vẫn treo bên trong bồn, và tài xế của xe tải sau đó lấy nó ra.\nĐây là Phương pháp #3: Làm trước. Nó thường được sử dụng bởi các nhà phát minh.\nHãy xem xét một vấn đề trong y học. Một bó bột rất khó tháo ra mà không chạm vào da. Một nhà phát minh đã đề xuất chèn một ống cao su chứa một lưỡi cưa mỏng bên dưới lớp bột. Khi đến lúc tháo bỏ bó bột, bác sĩ lấy một khung cưa tay, kết nối nó với các đầu của lưỡi cưa, và cắt lớp bột từ bên trong ra ngoài."

    "text": "Chương 3 Các mâu thuẫn kỹ thuật\nCho đến nay chúng ta đã học được ba phương pháp hay thủ tục. Bạn có thể nghĩ rằng điều này sẽ đơn giản - chỉ cần học hàng trăm phương pháp và bạn có thể giải quyết bất kỳ vấn đề nào. Đáng tiếc là nó phức tạp hơn nhiều. Hãy xem xét ví dụ sau:\nCó những máy làm ống thép hàn có đường kính lớn. Trong xưởng, công nhân treo những cuộn băng thép lớn. Đầu của băng này được đưa vào máy, máy biến băng thành ống. Ống hàn ra khỏi máy với tốc độ hai feet mỗi giây. Mọi thứ đều ổn, ngoại trừ việc ống phải được cắt theo một độ dài cụ thể.\nGiả sử chúng ta cần làm những ống dài 12 feet. Điều này có nghĩa là cứ sau sáu giây phải cắt một ống. Một lưỡi cắt đĩa quay bắt đầu cắt ống ngay khi ống đạt đến 12 feet. Lưỡi cắt di chuyển cùng với ống khi nó ra khỏi máy. Sau khi cắt ống, lưỡi cắt quay trở lại điểm xuất phát. Toàn bộ quá trình này cần được hoàn thành trong chưa đầy sáu giây.\nĐể cắt ống nhanh hơn, cần có một cơ chế cắt rất mạnh mẽ. Vì một cơ chế như vậy phải lớn và nặng, nó sẽ mất tốc độ khi di chuyển dọc theo ống. Nếu chúng ta làm cho cơ chế cắt nhẹ hơn và nhỏ hơn để tăng tốc độ, nó không thể cắt ống nhanh như cần thiết. Điều này tạo thành một vòng luẩn quẩn.\nĐể giải quyết loại vấn đề này, các kỹ sư thường sử dụng giải pháp thỏa hiệp. Kết quả của sự thỏa hiệp như vậy là cơ chế cắt không cắt nhanh cũng không di chuyển nhanh, vì vậy ống ra khỏi máy chậm hơn 1,5 lần so với cần thiết - một tình huống rất đáng thất vọng.\nCó lẽ bạn đã tìm ra giải pháp: Làm trước - cắt băng thép trước khi nó đến máy. Tuy nhiên, điều này sẽ không giải quyết được vấn đề vì bây giờ chúng ta sẽ mất thời gian nạp máy cho mỗi ống. Năng suất cao của máy hàn ống này phụ thuộc vào một quá trình liên tục không bị gián đoạn.\nVấn đề này đã không được giải quyết trong một thời gian dài. Bằng cách sử dụng các thủ thuật khác nhau, các kỹ sư đã tăng tốc độ của lưỡi cắt nhưng mất độ chính xác của chiều dài ống. Một số ống ra dài hơn, số khác ngắn hơn. Một hệ thống điện tử phức tạp đã được thiết kế và độ chính xác tăng lên - cùng với chi phí sản xuất và bảo trì.\nNhà Phát minh xuất hiện, tất nhiên, và đề xuất sử dụng hai phương pháp: Phương pháp #3: Làm trước và Phương pháp #4: Làm ít hơn một chút.\nÝ nghĩa của phương pháp thứ tư là: Nếu một hành động không thể thực hiện hoàn toàn, nó phải được thực hiện một phần. Điều này có nghĩa là băng thép nên được khắc rãnh, không phải cắt đứt. Sau khi ống được hàn đến độ dài yêu cầu, một cú giật nhẹ sẽ đủ để tách nó khỏi ống tiếp theo. Đó là một giải pháp tuyệt vời, phải không? Lưỡi cắt đĩa “bay” bị loại bỏ hoàn toàn. Ống đi qua một nam châm điện. Một xung dòng điện, một cú đứt gãy nhanh, và ống được tách ra.\nNhư bạn có thể thấy, “mánh khóe” là có sự kết hợp của hai phương pháp. Riêng lẻ, hai phương pháp sẽ không mang lại kết quả cần thiết.\nMười nghìn kết hợp hai phương pháp có thể được tạo ra từ một trăm phương pháp riêng lẻ! Bạn có thể tưởng tượng số lượng giải pháp chúng ta có thể đạt được nếu chúng ta sử dụng kết hợp ba, bốn hoặc năm phương pháp. Vì vậy, hãy ngừng giải quyết vấn đề bằng cách sắp xếp các giải pháp khác nhau hoặc sử dụng phương pháp thử và sai.\nMột số phương pháp giải quyết đã được biết đến ngay cả vào cuối thế kỷ 19. Các chuyên gia khác nhau từ đó đã lập danh sách cụ thể 20 đến 30 phương pháp. Nếu chúng ta tiến thêm một bước nữa - không chỉ thêm các phương pháp mới mà còn phân loại và kết hợp chúng - chúng ta có thể giải quyết nhiều vấn đề hơn nữa.\nNgười ta nhận thấy rằng các phương pháp đơn lẻ chỉ có thể được sử dụng trong các lĩnh vực hạn chế. Do đó, vẫn khó để loại bỏ phương pháp thử và sai.\nNếu chúng ta thử nhìn các vấn đề kỹ thuật từ một góc độ khác để hiểu cách các vấn đề phát sinh thì sao? Định nghĩa của một “vấn đề phát minh” hay “vấn đề kỹ thuật” là gì?\nHãy nhìn lại vấn đề của máy làm ống. Đó là một máy phức tạp với nhiều hệ thống và bộ phận cơ khí. Khi hiệu quả của một hệ thống được tăng lên - máy hàn ống kim loại - toàn bộ trở nên hiệu quả hơn. Tuy nhiên, ngay lập tức một mâu thuẫn kỹ thuật xuất hiện: Máy hàn ống nhanh hơn nhiều so với khả năng cơ chế cắt có thể cắt ống.\nĐể giải quyết vấn đề mới này - càng hàn nhanh, quá trình cắt càng khó khăn - một nỗ lực đã được thực hiện để tăng công suất của cơ chế cắt. Một lần nữa, một mâu thuẫn kỹ thuật xuất hiện: Để tăng tốc độ cắt ống, cần có một cơ chế cắt phức tạp và nặng hơn. Tất nhiên, cơ chế cắt nặng hơn và phức tạp hơn này di chuyển chậm hơn dọc theo ống, một lần nữa làm chậm toàn bộ quá trình.\nCác hệ thống kỹ thuật tương tự như các sinh vật sống. Chúng bao gồm các bộ phận có liên quan với nhau. Thay đổi một phần của hệ thống có thể có tác động tiêu cực đến các phần khác của hệ thống.\nMột cải tiến trong một phần của hệ thống làm suy giảm các phần khác của hệ thống hoặc các hệ thống liền kề tạo ra một Mâu thuẫn Kỹ thuật - và việc tạo ra một phát minh đòi hỏi phải loại bỏ các Mâu thuẫn Kỹ thuật.\nMột giải pháp phát minh luôn có hai yêu cầu: (1) Cải thiện một phần hoặc đặc điểm duy nhất của hệ thống mà không (2) làm suy giảm các phần hoặc đặc điểm khác của hệ thống hoặc các hệ thống liền kề.\nVấn đề 8 Phương tiện cho hành tinh Sao Hỏa\nTrong một câu chuyện khoa học viễn tưởng về khám phá không gian, một cuộc thám hiểm đến Sao Hỏa đã được mô tả. Tàu vũ trụ hạ cánh trong một thung lũng đá và các phi hành gia nhanh chóng chuẩn bị phương tiện của họ cho chuyến đi trên bề mặt hành tinh. Phương tiện đặc biệt này được thiết kế với những lốp xe bơm phồng lớn. Ngay trên những bước đầu tiên trên một sườn dốc, phương tiện đã bị lật.\nVà đột nhiên… Không, đáng tiếc là Nhà Phát minh không thể xuất hiện trong câu chuyện này. Bạn nghĩ Nhà Phát minh sẽ đề xuất điều gì?\nHãy nhớ rằng các phi hành gia không có cách nào thay đổi lốp xe.\nVấn đề này cũng đã được đăng trên một tạp chí thanh niên. Trong phần lớn các lá thư nhận được, câu trả lời là treo một trọng lượng nặng bên dưới phương tiện. Trọng tâm của phương tiện sẽ trở nên thấp hơn và tăng tính ổn định của phương tiện.\nĐừng vội vàng diễn đạt ý tưởng của bạn. Hãy phân tích các đề xuất khác trước. Bây giờ chúng ta có một tiêu chí để đánh giá. Mâu thuẫn kỹ thuật đã được loại bỏ hay chưa?\nTrọng lượng treo bên dưới phương tiện sẽ tăng tính ổn định nhưng đồng thời sẽ làm giảm khả năng di chuyển của nó. Khoảng sáng gầm xe sẽ ít hơn và khiến trọng lượng va chạm với đá và mặt đất thường xuyên hơn. Một mâu thuẫn kỹ thuật!\nĐây là một số ý tưởng và đề xuất khác: a. Xả một phần hơi của lốp xe, để chúng chỉ đầy một nửa. b. Lắp thêm một lốp xe ở mỗi bên của phương tiện. c. Có một số thành viên trong đoàn nghiêng ra ngoài phương tiện để duy trì cân bằng…\nKhông quá khó để thấy rằng trong mỗi ý tưởng này, chúng ta đạt được điều gì đó trong khi mất đi điều gì đó khác. Xả hơi lốp xe làm giảm tốc độ của phương tiện. Thêm lốp xe làm cho phương tiện phức tạp hơn - và chúng ta không có phương tiện để làm điều đó trên Sao Hỏa. Yêu cầu các phi hành gia thực hiện các động tác nhào lộn là một rủi ro không thể biện minh. Do khó tránh được các mâu thuẫn, một trong những độc giả đã viết: “Không có gì có thể làm được. Hãy để các phi hành gia đi bộ.”\nBạn có thể tưởng tượng một thủy thủ không biết rằng cần phải tránh các rạn san hô và vách đá không? Nhà phát minh giống như thủy thủ đó khi anh ta không biết rằng anh ta phải loại bỏ mâu thuẫn kỹ thuật.\nBạn có nhớ vấn đề về đo áp suất bên trong bóng đèn điện không? Ý tưởng đập vỡ bóng đèn đã được cấp bằng sáng chế, mặc dù trong thực tế một phát minh đã không được tạo ra vì mâu thuẫn không được loại bỏ. Chúng ta đập vỡ càng nhiều bóng đèn, thử nghiệm càng chính xác và chúng ta sẽ có càng nhiều bóng đèn bị vỡ.\nĐây là bản dịch tiếng Việt của đoạn văn bản:\nTrước khi bạn nói “Tôi đã giải quyết được một vấn đề Phát minh!”, hãy tự hỏi bản thân, “Tôi đã loại bỏ loại mâu thuẫn nào?”\nKhông khó để treo một trọng lượng bên dưới phương tiện. Ý tưởng là treo nó càng thấp càng tốt. Bây giờ chúng ta có một vấn đề khác. Một trọng lượng treo thấp sẽ giảm khoảng sáng gầm giữa phương tiện và mặt đất. Mong muốn giải quyết vấn đề này mà không sử dụng “thủ thuật phát minh” sẽ không cải thiện được khả năng di chuyển của phương tiện.\nHãy thử một phương pháp mới, một thủ thuật mới: Chúng ta sẽ đặt trọng lượng rất thấp, thực tế là ngay sát mặt đất - không phải bên ngoài phương tiện mà ở bên trong. Chúng ta sẽ giấu trọng lượng bên trong - các lốp xe! Chúng ta sẽ chèn các viên bi thép hoặc đá tròn và chúng sẽ lăn…\nĐây là Phương pháp #5, gọi là “Matreshka”. Matreshka là một con búp bê có một con búp bê nhỏ hơn bên trong nó, và một con búp bê khác bên trong con búp bê thứ hai, và cứ tiếp tục như vậy. Để tiết kiệm không gian, có thể đặt một vật thể bên trong một vật thể khác.\nMột bằng sáng chế về điều này đã được cấp ở Nhật Bản để cải thiện sự ổn định của xe nâng hàng và cần cẩu tự hành.\nVấn đề và câu trả lời giống như hai bờ của một con sông. Một nỗ lực đoán câu trả lời giống như nhảy từ bờ này sang bờ kia của con sông. Các mâu thuẫn kỹ thuật và phương pháp loại bỏ chúng hoạt động như một cây cầu. Lý thuyết giải quyết vấn đề kỹ thuật tương tự như khoa học xây dựng những cây cầu vô hình mang những suy nghĩ dẫn đến ý tưởng mới.\nNhân tiện, mâu thuẫn và phương pháp nên được so sánh với các cột trụ của cây cầu. Không dễ để nhảy từ cột này sang cột khác. Ngoài các cột, chúng ta cần các tấm ván trên cùng để có thể đi bộ từ bên này sang bên kia. Chúng ta cần một cách tiếp cận đặc biệt để đi từ nhiệm vụ đến mâu thuẫn và từ mâu thuẫn đến phương pháp (thủ thuật). Sau đó, chúng ta có thể đi từng bước từ phát biểu vấn đề đến câu trả lời.\nChúng ta sẽ nói thêm về các phần của cây cầu sau. Điều rất quan trọng cần hiểu là:\nNhà phát minh phải tìm và loại bỏ các mâu thuẫn kỹ thuật.\nLý thuyết giải quyết vấn đề kỹ thuật bắt đầu với phát biểu rất đơn giản này."

Và cuối cùng, bạn có một chỉ số rất đáng tin cậy để đánh giá ý tưởng của mình. Một ý tưởng phát minh tốt chắc chắn sẽ loại bỏ các mâu thuẫn.\nTôi sẽ đưa cho bạn một số bài toán làm bài tập. Hãy nhớ, đừng sắp xếp các ý tưởng. Hãy sử dụng các phương pháp bạn đã học, tức là các hiệu ứng vật lý và kiến thức về mâu thuẫn.\nVấn đề 9 Một cái tốt bằng nhiều cái\nCó một lần trong phòng thí nghiệm, một thiết bị được xây dựng để nghiên cứu chuyển động của các giọt phân bón lỏng sẽ được phun từ máy bay. Không khí chảy qua một ống mang hàng triệu giọt nhỏ. Tuy nhiên, thiết bị này chỉ tạo ra những giọt rất nhỏ.\nTrong quá trình thí nghiệm, người ta nhận thấy rằng các giọt có kích thước lớn hơn cũng cần được kiểm tra.\n“Hãy mua một vài thiết bị,” một kỹ sư đề xuất.\n“Sẽ mất nhiều thời gian hơn chúng ta có. Ngoài ra, nó quá đắt,” một kỹ sư khác phản đối. “Hai mươi thử nghiệm sẽ đòi hỏi hai mươi vòi phun khác nhau.”\nVà, tất nhiên, Nhà Phát minh đột nhiên xuất hiện.\n“Một vòi phun sẽ hoạt động tốt như nhiều vòi phun khác nhau,” anh ta nói. “Kích thước của các giọt có thể được thay đổi nếu…”\nAnh ta giải thích nên làm gì.\nBạn nghĩ sao?\nCó lẽ vấn đề #9 có vẻ đơn giản với bạn. Mặc dù một vài vấn đề tiếp theo phức tạp hơn, tôi nghĩ bạn sẽ giải quyết được chúng.\nVấn đề 10 Làm cho nước mềm hơn\nCó lần, một huấn luyện viên nổi tiếng - một cựu vô địch nhảy cầu - than phiền với đồng nghiệp: “Ngày nay khó làm việc quá. Các cú nhảy ngày càng trở nên phức tạp hơn. Chúng ta phải nghĩ ra các kết hợp mới và thử chúng. Vấn đề là số lượng các cú tiếp đất không thành công đã tăng lên, gây thương tích cho các vận động viên nhảy cầu. Nước không mềm lắm khi bạn rơi từ một tháp cao. Đôi khi tôi cảm thấy một vận động viên có thể thực hiện những cú nhảy mới, nhưng thường sợ bị thương và không thể tham gia cuộc thi.”\n“Chúng ta không thể làm gì được,” đồng nghiệp của anh ta nói. “Đây là bản chất của môn thể thao mà chúng ta cam kết. Trong đội của tôi cũng có các chấn thương trong các cú nhảy không thành công.”\nVà đột nhiên Nhà Phát minh xuất hiện.\n“Sẽ không còn thương tích nữa. Chúng ta sẽ làm cho nước mềm hơn. Điều chúng ta cần làm là…”\nBạn nghĩ chúng ta cần làm gì với nước để làm cho nó mềm hơn và loại bỏ thương tích trong các cú nhảy?\nVấn đề 11 Sơn vĩnh cửu\nChủ tịch của một công ty nội thất nói với kỹ sư của mình: “Trong năm qua, chúng ta đã bán một trăm bộ nội thất cho các trường mẫu giáo. Đáng tiếc là khách hàng đang phàn nàn rằng bọn trẻ đã bóc hoặc làm xước lớp sơn trên đồ nội thất!”\n“Đây không phải là vấn đề của chúng ta!” kỹ sư nói, có vẻ bị xúc phạm. “Bạn có thể làm xước ngay cả lớp sơn cứng nhất. Điều này không liên quan gì đến chúng ta. Có lẽ họ nên mua đồ nội thất chưa hoàn thiện.”\n“Không,” chủ tịch nói. “Có đồ nội thất màu sắc trong trường mẫu giáo là tốt. Có lẽ chúng ta có thể tìm một loại sơn sẽ thấm sâu vào bên trong gỗ?”\n“Đây là một ảo tưởng!” kỹ sư cười. “Hàng nghìn lần người ta đã cố gắng thấm sơn vào gỗ với kết quả rất kém. Bạn biết điều đó.”\nVà đột nhiên Nhà Phát minh xuất hiện.\n“Không, đây không phải là ảo tưởng!” anh ta kêu lên. “Cần một chút sáng tạo và can đảm để giải quyết vấn đề này.

    "text": "Chương 5 Chồng chéo cái không thể chồng chéo (Kết hợp cái không thể kết hợp)\nCon cáo bị săn đuổi, nếu bạn tin Bá tước Munchausen, đã tìm ra cách nhảy ra khỏi chính bộ da của mình. Hãy để câu chuyện săn bắn này cho lương tâm của Bá tước. Đồng thời, chúng ta đã giải quyết một vấn đề phát minh. Chúng ta tìm kiếm một câu trả lời, tìm thấy các mâu thuẫn kỹ thuật và ngay khi có vẻ như câu trả lời đã ở trong tầm tay - đột nhiên câu trả lời biến mất!\nNgay cả khi bạn nắm chắc mâu thuẫn kỹ thuật trong tay, không có gì đảm bảo rằng bạn sẽ tìm ra câu trả lời. Cùng một mâu thuẫn kỹ thuật có thể được loại bỏ bằng cách sử dụng các phương pháp khác nhau.\nKhi chúng ta không thể tìm thấy câu trả lời, đó là vì chúng ta đã bỏ qua một bước. Bước này là ở trung tâm của mọi phát minh thực sự. Ẩn sau mọi mâu thuẫn kỹ thuật là một mâu thuẫn vật lý.\nNó trông như thế này: Một phần của hệ thống kỹ thuật phải có đặc tính “A” để thực hiện một hành động nhất định, và nó cũng phải có đặc tính trái ngược “không-A” để thực hiện hành động ngược lại.\nMột Mâu thuẫn Kỹ thuật thường liên quan đến toàn bộ hệ thống, hoặc một vài phần của hệ thống. Một Mâu thuẫn Vật lý chỉ liên quan đến một phần của hệ thống.\nHiểu được phát biểu này sẽ làm tăng đáng kể cơ hội của bạn để đạt được câu trả lời đúng.\nHãy xem xét Vấn đề #5 - loại bỏ cát khỏi các bộ phận đúc. Mâu thuẫn vật lý trong vấn đề này là: “Các hạt phải cứng để làm sạch các bộ phận, và đồng thời không cứng (lỏng hoặc khí) để có thể loại bỏ khỏi khu vực bên trong các bộ phận”. Ngay khi loại mâu thuẫn này được xác định, câu trả lời trở nên rõ ràng. Chúng ta phải áp dụng Phương pháp #2: Thay đổi trạng thái của các tính chất vật lý - và không gì khác! Hãy làm các hạt từ đá khô. Các hạt cứng sẽ làm sạch các bộ phận, và sau đó chuyển thành khí và bay hơi.\nTrong Vấn đề #6, làm thế nào để tạo lỗ trên ống cao su, các mâu thuẫn vật lý gần như giống nhau. Ống phải cứng để có thể khoan lỗ vào nó, và phải mềm để giữ tính đàn hồi. Phương pháp cũng giống nhau. Chúng ta phải đông lạnh ống, hoặc đổ đầy nước vào và đông lạnh nước. Sau khi các lỗ được tạo ra, ống hoặc nước nên được làm nóng.\nCó những quy tắc nhất định cho phép chúng ta, trong quá trình phân tích vấn đề, chuyển từ một mâu thuẫn kỹ thuật sang một mâu thuẫn vật lý. Trong nhiều trường hợp, mâu thuẫn vật lý có thể được xác định từ chính mô tả của vấn đề.\nVấn đề 12 Các giọt trên màn hình\nQuá trình hàn được nghiên cứu trong một phòng thí nghiệm. Các nhà khoa học quan tâm tìm hiểu cách một thanh kim loại sẽ tan chảy trong một hồ quang điện và cách hồ quang này thay đổi trong quá trình này. Họ bật nguồn, tạo hồ quang và quay phim những gì xảy ra. Khi xem lại đoạn phim, họ thấy rằng chỉ có hồ quang là nhìn thấy được. Hồ quang sáng hơn các giọt kim loại, và do đó không thể nhìn thấy các giọt. Quyết định lặp lại thí nghiệm. Trong thí nghiệm mới, một hồ quang thứ hai được đốt để chiếu sáng các giọt. Một bộ phim được quay lại. Bây giờ chỉ có các giọt được nhìn thấy trên màn hình. Hồ quang ban đầu hoàn toàn không nhìn thấy trên màn hình. Các nhà khoa học băn khoăn, “Chúng ta nên làm gì?”\nVà đột nhiên Nhà Phát minh xuất hiện.\n“Một mâu thuẫn vật lý điển hình!” anh ta nói. “Vấn đề là…”\nĐó là loại mâu thuẫn vật lý nào, và làm thế nào chúng ta có thể loại bỏ nó?\nNếu bạn đã đọc kỹ các điều kiện của vấn đề, bạn có thể dễ dàng xác định mâu thuẫn vật lý. Hồ quang thứ hai phải có mặt để nhìn thấy các giọt kim loại, và nó không được có mặt để nhìn thấy hồ quang đầu tiên.\nCác mâu thuẫn kỹ thuật thường được xác định bằng các thuật ngữ rất nhẹ nhàng. Ví dụ, để tăng tốc độ của một chiếc xe tải, chúng ta cần giảm trọng lượng hàng hóa. Tốc độ mâu thuẫn với trọng lượng. Tuy nhiên, có thể đạt được một giải pháp thỏa hiệp. Trong các mâu thuẫn vật lý, xung đột rất mạnh. May mắn thay, thế giới phát minh có quy luật riêng của nó: “Mức độ xung đột càng cao, việc xác định và loại bỏ nó càng dễ dàng”.\nHồ quang chiếu sáng các giọt phải có và không được có. Điều này có nghĩa là nó phải có mặt trong một khoảng thời gian nào đó, và không được có mặt trong một khoảng thời gian khác. Bật và tắt, bật và tắt. Trong một số khung hình, chúng ta sẽ thấy các giọt, trong những khung khác chỉ có hồ quang. Trong quá trình chiếu phim, cả hai đối tượng sẽ xuất hiện trên màn hình, và chúng ta sẽ thấy cả hồ quang và các giọt.\nĐây là Phương pháp #6: Tách các đặc tính mâu thuẫn trong không gian hoặc thời gian.\nBạn có nhớ vấn đề về các ống hàn không? Băng thép được cắt một phần ở một số khu vực và không được cắt ở các khu vực khác. Có một cách khó hơn để chồng chéo cái không thể chồng chéo: Gán một đặc tính cho toàn bộ đối tượng, và đặc tính đối lập cho các phần của nó. Ban đầu, có vẻ như điều này là không thể. Thật vậy, làm thế nào bạn có thể xây dựng một tòa tháp trắng từ các viên gạch đen?\nHãy lấy ví dụ về dây xích cho xe đạp. Mỗi phần tử của nó đều cứng, nhưng toàn bộ dây xích lại linh hoạt. Tóm lại, các mâu thuẫn vật lý đòi hỏi chúng ta phải chồng chéo cái không thể chồng chéo không dẫn đến ngõ cụt. Ngược lại, chúng tạo điều kiện và làm dễ dàng quá trình tìm kiếm giải pháp tốt nhất.\nMột ví dụ khác, hãy xem xét Vấn đề #10 - Làm thế nào để làm nước mềm hơn. Đây là một vấn đề khó. Vẫn chưa rõ phải bắt đầu từ đâu. Hãy thử xác định mâu thuẫn vật lý trước. Hồ bơi phải đầy nước, và đồng thời hồ bơi phải đầy một thứ gì đó mềm hơn để vận động viên nhảy cầu không bị thương trong khi nhảy. Cái gì mềm hơn nước? Khí hoặc không khí. Kết luận là: Hồ bơi phải đầy…\nCó vẻ như chúng ta đã đi vào ngõ cụt. Nước hỗ trợ vận động viên nhảy cầu, nhưng nó “cứng” và nguy hiểm trong khi nhảy. Khí thì mềm, nhưng bạn không thể nhảy vào một hồ bơi chỉ đầy khí hoặc không khí (hồ bơi thực sự là “trống rỗng”). Bây giờ, khi chúng ta tiết lộ mâu thuẫn, chúng ta có thể thấy một tia sáng của câu trả lời. Hãy có cả nước và khí trong hồ bơi. Hãy để vận động viên nhảy cầu nhảy vào hỗn hợp nước và khí - nước có khí. Đây chính xác là cách các nhà phát minh Xô Viết đã nhận được Bằng sáng chế #1127604. Trong bằng sáng chế này, nước được bão hòa với các bọt khí trước khi nhảy. Mâu thuẫn được loại bỏ. (Thậm chí 90% nước vẫn là nước, mặc dù bạn không cảm thấy nó theo cách tương tự).\nChú ý đến con đường zíc zắc chúng ta đã đi để đạt được giải pháp. Điều kiện tồn tại trước đó cho vấn đề chỉ là sự tồn tại của nước - và do đó câu trả lời không rõ ràng. Chúng ta đi từ nước đến không-nước (không khí). Có vẻ như vấn đề trở nên phức tạp hơn. Bước tiếp theo rất quan trọng: kết hợp nước và không-nước (nước và không khí, cứng và mềm, cứng và linh hoạt, nóng và lạnh).\nNhư chúng ta đã nói trước đây, nó có thể được thực hiện - trong một khung thời gian hoặc không gian.\nDưới đây là bản dịch tiếng Việt của đoạn văn bản:\nVấn đề 13 Dày và mỏng\nMột nhà máy nhận được đơn đặt hàng sản xuất một lượng lớn tấm kính hình bầu dục dày một milimét. Đầu tiên, các tấm hình chữ nhật được cắt và sau đó các góc được mài thành hình bầu dục theo yêu cầu. Vì kính rất mỏng nên có nhiều tấm bị vỡ.\n“Chúng ta nên làm các tấm dày hơn,” người công nhân nói với người giám sát.\n“Chúng ta không thể,” người giám sát nói. “Chúng ta chỉ có đơn đặt hàng cho các tấm dày 1 mm!”\nVà đột nhiên Nhà Phát minh xuất hiện.\n“Mâu thuẫn vật lý!” anh ta kêu lên. “Tấm kính của chúng ta phải vừa dày vừa mỏng. Mâu thuẫn này có thể được tách ra trong một khung thời gian. Tấm kính sẽ dày trong thời gian gia công!”\nBạn nghĩ gì về điều này?\nVấn đề 14 Làm thế nào để thoát khỏi ngõ cụt\nMột công ty bắt đầu sản xuất một máy mới. Rất sớm, xưởng gặp phải một vấn đề không mong đợi. Một bộ phận của máy này phải được làm từ một tấm thép đặc biệt. Tấm thép phải được gia nhiệt điện đến 1200°C. Sau đó, tấm thép đã được gia nhiệt sẽ được đặt dưới một máy ép để tạo hình theo yêu cầu. Trong quá trình này, người ta phát hiện ra rằng khi tấm thép được gia nhiệt trên 800°C, nó bị hư hỏng do tác động có hại của không khí.\nNgười giám sát lập tức triệu tập một cuộc họp.\n“Tình huống giống như trong một câu chuyện cổ tích. Đi về bên phải gặp rắc rối; đi về bên trái gặp rắc rối còn lớn hơn. Tấm thép phải được gia nhiệt đến 1200°C nếu không nó không thể được tạo hình, và đồng thời nó không thể được gia nhiệt trên 800°C để không làm hỏng bề mặt,” anh ta nói.\n“Rất đơn giản,” một trong những kỹ sư trẻ nhất nói. “Chúng ta sẽ gia nhiệt nó đến 1000°C, nhiệt độ trung gian.”\n“Điều đó không tốt,” người thợ cả phản đối. “Các tấm sẽ bị hư hỏng vì chúng vẫn sẽ được gia nhiệt vượt quá nhiệt độ chấp nhận được của chúng, và việc tạo hình không thể thực hiện được vì nhiệt độ không đủ cao.”\n“Đây là một nhiệm vụ phức tạp,” người giám sát nói. “Chúng ta phải giải quyết vấn đề này ngay bây giờ.”\nVà Nhà Phát minh xuất hiện ở đó.\n“Tôi có giải pháp!” anh ta nói.\nBạn nghĩ Nhà Phát minh đã đề xuất điều gì?\nVấn đề 15 Lò xo cứng đầu\nHãy tưởng tượng rằng bạn phải nén một lò xo xoắn dài 4” và đường kính 2”, đặt nó bên trong một cuốn sách và đóng sách lại theo cách mà lò xo sẽ không bung ra nhưng vẫn sẵn sàng mở rộng bất cứ lúc nào. Một tình huống tương tự đã xảy ra khi các kỹ sư đang lắp ráp một thiết bị. Cần phải nén một lò xo, đặt nó bên trong thiết bị và đóng nắp lại. Làm thế nào để thực hiện điều này?\n“Chúng ta sẽ buộc nó bằng một sợi dây,” một trong các kỹ sư nói. “Nếu không, bạn không thể làm gì được với lò xo cứng đầu này!”\n“Điều này không ổn,” kỹ sư khác phản đối. “Lò xo bên trong thiết bị phải tự do.”\nVà đột nhiên Nhà Phát minh xuất hiện.\n“Mọi thứ đều ổn!” anh ta nói. “Lò xo phải tự do và không được tự do, bị nén và không bị nén. Một khi chúng ta có một mâu thuẫn, chúng ta có một nhiệm vụ phát minh.”\nBạn sẽ giải quyết vấn đề này như thế nào?"

    "text": "Chương 6 Thuyền + Thuyền\nTrong nhiều cuốn sách về lịch sử phát triển kỹ thuật, thế kỷ 19 được gọi là “Thế kỷ của Hơi nước”. Các nhà sử học trong nửa đầu thế kỷ này gọi đây là “Thế kỷ của Điện”. Tên gọi nào phù hợp dựa trên những phát triển trong nửa sau của thế kỷ chúng ta? Cho đến nay chúng ta chưa có một ý kiến thống nhất. Có thể là: “Thế kỷ của Nguyên tử”, hoặc “Thế kỷ của Khám phá Không gian”. Có lẽ là “Thế kỷ của Hóa học”? Hoặc… “Điện tử”?\nNếu một kỹ sư sống vào đầu thế kỷ 20 có thể nhìn thấy cuộc sống của chúng ta ngày nay, có lẽ kỹ sư đó sẽ ngạc nhiên trước số lượng máy móc quen thuộc. Những máy móc này chủ yếu khác biệt về quy mô so với tổ tiên của chúng. Ô tô có kích thước của xe ngựa đã trở thành những xe đầu kéo lớn. Một máy bay chỉ có thể chở hai hoặc ba người đã trở thành máy bay chở khách chở 300 đến 400 người. Tàu thủy đã trở thành những thành phố nổi. Tuabin, cần cẩu, tòa nhà, phòng thí nghiệm nghiên cứu - mọi thứ đã trở nên lớn hơn gấp mười lần.\nHàng chục chiếc xe tải cũ trong quá khứ giờ đây tương đương với một xe tải siêu lớn chở tổng tải trọng của chúng. Đúng vậy, tổng trọng lượng là như nhau nhưng việc bảo dưỡng và bảo trì một xe tải siêu lớn cần ít người hơn. Việc bốc dỡ hàng hóa cũng mất ít thời gian hơn nhiều. Nhiều vấn đề phát minh ngày nay đã xuất hiện do sự phát triển này.\nHãy xem xét một vấn đề liên quan:\nVấn đề 16 Hạ cánh khẩn cấp\nMột máy bay vận tải khổng lồ đã hạ cánh khẩn cấp trên một cánh đồng cách sân bay 200 dặm. Máy bay được dỡ hàng và kiểm tra. Người ta phát hiện các vết nứt, vết lõm và hư hỏng bên ngoài. Cần phải di chuyển máy bay đến xưởng để sửa chữa. Vì máy bay nặng hơn một trăm tấn, nó phải được đưa đến xưởng một cách cẩn thận để tránh thiệt hại thêm. Các chuyên gia tụ họp lại. Sẽ không phải là một vấn đề lớn nếu máy bay nhỏ hơn.\n“Chúng ta không nên suy nghĩ quá nhiều,” một học viên thực tập nói.\nKhông ai mời cậu ta đến cuộc họp, nhưng cậu ta vẫn đến. Cậu ta có một ý tưởng và muốn trình bày nó. “Không có gì chúng ta có thể làm mà không cần một khinh khí cầu. Chúng ta phải móc máy bay vào khinh khí cầu và…”\n“Chàng trai trẻ,” một trong các chuyên gia buồn bã nói. “Chúng ta không có khinh khí cầu có khả năng đó. Hơn nữa, chúng ta không thể nâng máy bay lên không trung. Vậy nên, hãy quên khinh khí cầu đi.”\nVà đột nhiên Nhà Phát minh xuất hiện.\n“Bạn sai rồi,” anh ta nói. “Chúng ta cần một khinh khí cầu, và chúng ta không cần một khinh khí cầu. Chúng ta phải nâng máy bay - và chúng ta không cần phải nâng nó!”\nSau đó anh ta giải thích cách chúng ta có thể giải quyết những yêu cầu mâu thuẫn này.\nBạn có thể đoán Nhà Phát minh đã đề xuất điều gì không?\nKích thước của máy móc đã tăng nhanh chóng. Chúng đã tăng gấp đôi, gấp mười, và thậm chí gấp trăm lần.\nTuy nhiên, sự tăng trưởng không phải là vô hạn. Đến một lúc nào đó, việc tăng trưởng thêm nữa sẽ vừa không kinh tế vừa không có lợi. Tại thời điểm đó, nếu hai máy được kết hợp lại với nhau, một hệ thống mới xuất hiện. Hệ thống mới này sau đó bắt đầu phát triển và tiến hóa giống như các máy riêng lẻ trước đó.\nHãy nhớ lại lịch sử phát triển của tàu thủy. Chiếc thuyền đầu tiên được chèo bởi hai mái chèo. Chiếc tàu đầu tiên có một hàng mái chèo. Sau đó, những con tàu lớn hơn có hai, ba và bốn hàng mái chèo.\nỞ La Mã cổ đại, một con tàu được xây dựng với ba mươi hàng mái chèo! Rất khó để những người chèo phối hợp chuyển động của họ. Hơn nữa, các mái chèo dài và nặng. Khoảng cách giữa hàng mái chèo trên cùng và mặt nước hơn 60 feet.\nSau đó, mọi người bắt đầu xây dựng những con tàu bao gồm cả mái chèo và cánh buồm. Theo thời gian, kích thước của tàu tăng lên và số lượng và kích thước của cánh buồm tăng lên thay vì số lượng mái chèo. Dần dần, tàu chèo-buồm biến thành tàu buồm-chèo, và sau đó thành tàu buồm. Sau đó thiết bị buồm bắt đầu phát triển. Đầu tiên có một cột buồm, rồi hai cột buồm và cứ tiếp tục như vậy. Kích thước của cánh buồm tăng lên cũng như số lượng cánh buồm trên mỗi cột buồm.\nSau đó đến bước tiếp theo: Động cơ hơi nước được phát triển và con tàu buồm-hơi nước đầu tiên được xây dựng. Sau đó quá trình lặp lại một lần nữa. Tàu buồm-hơi nước biến thành tàu hơi nước-buồm, và sau đó thành tàu hơi nước.\nMỗi khi hệ thống A kết hợp với hệ thống B, một hệ thống mới AB xuất hiện. Hệ thống mới AB này, về nguyên tắc, có những đặc điểm mới - những phẩm chất mới mà cả A và B đều không có trước đó. Ngay cả khi một hệ thống mới được hình thành từ việc đơn giản A + B, kết quả không bằng 2A, mà là một cái gì đó lớn hơn. Ví dụ: Một thuyền cộng một thuyền kết hợp thành một hệ thống không bằng hai thuyền. Đó là một catamaran. Hệ thống catamaran ổn định hơn so với hai thuyền riêng biệt.\nĐặc điểm rất quan trọng này của hệ thống có thể dễ dàng được thấy trong vấn đề tiếp theo về bọ đục.\nVấn đề 17 Nhiệt kế cho bọ đục\nCó một lần, các nhà khoa học tụ họp để thảo luận về một vấn đề liên quan đến bọ đục. Người ta phát hiện ra rằng các điều kiện tồn tại của loài bọ nhỏ này đã được nghiên cứu rất ít. Không ai biết, ví dụ, nhiệt độ cơ thể của một con bọ đục là bao nhiêu.\n“Bọ đục rất nhỏ,” một nhà khoa học nói, “nhưng chúng ta không thể đặt nhiệt kế vào nó.”\n“Bạn nói đúng,” một nhà khoa học khác đồng ý, “chúng ta phải thiết kế một thiết bị đặc biệt.”\nVà đột nhiên Nhà Phát minh xuất hiện.\n“Không cần thiết phải phát triển một thiết bị mới,” anh ta nói. “Hãy lấy một cái thông thường…”\nBạn nghĩ Nhà Phát minh đã đề xuất điều gì?\nVấn đề này đã được đăng trên tạp chí Pioneer Youth và chỉ có một từ được thêm vào trong mô tả vấn đề: cốc. Nhà Phát minh nói: “Hãy lấy một cái cốc thủy tinh thông thường…”\nMột nửa số câu trả lời được đưa ra bởi độc giả là: “Lấy một cái cốc, đổ đầy nước, thả bọ đục vào đó và đo nhiệt độ bằng một nhiệt kế thông thường.” Đây không phải là câu trả lời đúng. Một con bọ đục nhỏ không thể thay đổi nhiệt độ của nước. Sự nhầm lẫn nằm ở từ “cốc”; một khi chúng ta có một cái cốc, nó phải được đổ đầy nước vì đây là mục đích chính của nó.\nĐây là một vấn đề phát minh tốt. Từ “cốc” khiến chúng ta suy nghĩ. Do đó, trong Lý thuyết Giải quyết Vấn đề Sáng tạo, có một quy tắc rất quan trọng: Loại bỏ các từ có thể dẫn đến ý tưởng sai lầm. Đây là Phương pháp #7.\nVí dụ, nếu một “vít có thể điều chỉnh vi mô” được đề cập trong vấn đề, nó nên được thay thế bằng những từ như “một thanh có thể điều chỉnh có chuyển động rất chính xác”. Từ “vít” biến mất, và ngay lập tức trở nên rõ ràng rằng giải pháp có thể không liên quan đến chuyển động xoay ốc vít hoặc thiết bị.\nTrong khi đó, hãy quay lại vấn đề của chúng ta. Cần phải lấy một cái cốc (hoặc hộp nhỏ hoặc túi nhựa), đổ đầy bọ đục vào đó, và đo nhiệt độ bằng một nhiệt kế thông thường. Một trăm con bọ đục sẽ tạo ra một hệ thống có những đặc điểm mới. Kích thước của hệ thống đó lớn hơn nhiều so với kích thước của các bộ phận riêng lẻ của nó. Do đó, sẽ không khó để đo nhiệt độ của bọ đục.\nTrong mỗi số của Công báo Chính thức, chúng ta có thể tìm thấy những đổi mới kỹ thuật được thực hiện bằng cách kết hợp các đối tượng tương tự hoặc khác nhau thành một hệ thống.\nĐây là Phương pháp #8: Kết hợp các đối tượng tương tự hoặc khác nhau thành một hệ thống.\nVí dụ, hãy xem xét Bằng sáng chế #408586. Nhiều năm trước, các nồi hơi được xếp riêng biệt. Bây giờ chúng được đặt vào một khối. Cấu trúc trở nên đơn giản hơn, chiều dài đường ống được giảm và khối chỉ cần một ống khói.\nMột ví dụ khác: Ngũ cốc trong một xi-lô tỏa ra nhiều nhiệt, do đó cần phải làm mát xi-lô. Chuồng trại cho vật nuôi cần được sưởi ấm. Trong Bằng sáng chế #251801, tác giả đề xuất kết hợp hai công trình này. Nhiệt từ xi-lô giờ đây sưởi ấm chuồng trại.\nDưới đây là bản dịch tiếng Việt của đoạn văn bản:\nMột ví dụ khác: Nếu chúng ta lấy một thuyền máy và lắp đặt một xe trượt tuyết (hoặc xe máy) lên nó, không có phát minh mới nào. Tuy nhiên, một nhà phát minh người Mỹ đã nhận được Bằng sáng chế số 3935832 cho một phương tiện vừa là thuyền vừa là xe trượt tuyết cùng một lúc. Nó chỉ sử dụng một động cơ, động cơ của xe trượt tuyết. Đây là một hệ thống mới.\nMột thợ săn đôi khi muốn có hai khẩu súng trường với các loại đạn khác nhau - đạn và viên bi. Đi săn với hai khẩu súng trường không thuận tiện. Thợ săn cần sử dụng một khẩu súng và sau đó đột nhiên cần sử dụng khẩu kia. Thường thì thợ săn không có đủ thời gian để chuyển đổi chúng. Nếu hai khẩu súng được buộc lại với nhau thì sao? Trong quá khứ, đó chính xác là những gì mọi người đã làm. Sau đó họ nhận ra rằng hai khẩu súng buộc lại với nhau có nhiều bộ phận chung - và những bộ phận này có thể được loại bỏ. Thật vậy, tại sao khẩu súng kép này cần hai báng súng? Sau khi các bộ phận thừa được loại bỏ, kết quả là khẩu súng hai nòng.\nMột ví dụ khéo léo khác: Các vật liệu thải - tro và xỉ - được tạo ra tại các nhà máy luyện kim và được loại bỏ qua đường ống bằng nước. Một lớp cứng phát triển trên thành bên trong của những đường ống này. Lớp vỏ này thường phải được loại bỏ bằng tay. Các kỹ sư đã cố gắng giải quyết vấn đề này trong một thời gian dài. Các kỹ sư khác cố gắng giải quyết vấn đề khác là bảo vệ bề mặt bên trong của đường ống thải than khỏi bị mài mòn quá mức. Các hạt than sắc nhọn làm xước kim loại, khiến các đường ống khó bảo vệ. Nhà phát minh M. Shampov đề xuất tạo ra một hệ thống đơn chung từ những đường ống này. Đầu tiên, đường ống sẽ bơm bùn tro và xỉ tạo ra lớp vỏ bên trong đường ống, sau đó nó sẽ chuyển sang bùn thải than sẽ làm sạch các đường ống. Chu kỳ sau đó lặp lại. Vấn đề được giải quyết.\nĐể tạo ra một hệ thống mới, người ta nên kết hợp các đối tượng theo cách mà một tính năng mới xuất hiện.\nBây giờ chúng ta sẽ đưa ra một vấn đề khác làm bài tập.\nVấn đề 18 Cách khác\nMột nhà máy nhận được đơn đặt hàng sản xuất các bộ lọc thủy tinh đường kính một mét và cao hai mét. Các lỗ phải được tạo đều khắp bộ lọc. Các kỹ sư nhìn vào bản vẽ và bị sốc. Hàng nghìn lỗ nhỏ phải được tạo ra trên mỗi bộ lọc.\n“Làm thế nào chúng ta nên tạo ra những lỗ này?” kỹ sư trưởng hỏi cấp dưới. “Chúng ta sẽ khoan chúng sao?”\n“Có lẽ chúng ta nên làm chúng bằng những cây kim dài nung đỏ,” một kỹ sư trẻ nói một cách không chắc chắn.\nVà đột nhiên Nhà Phát minh xuất hiện.\n“Chúng ta không cần mũi khoan hay kim,” anh ta nói. “Mọi thứ nên được làm theo cách khác. Lấy…”\nBạn nghĩ Nhà Phát minh đã đề xuất điều gì?\nĐây là một gợi ý: Làm theo cách khác. Chúng ta sẽ không tạo lỗ trên xi-lanh, mà tạo xi-lanh từ… lỗ. Lấy các ống thủy tinh, bó chúng lại, và đó là một xi-lanh với các lỗ. Hoặc, lấy các thanh thủy tinh, bó chúng lại, và đó là một bộ lọc với các khe hở giữa các thanh.\nDễ dàng lắp ráp và tháo rời.\nNhân tiện, hãy chú ý rằng trong ví dụ này hai phương pháp đã được sử dụng.\nXi-lanh đặc được thay thế bằng nhiều ống hoặc thanh nhỏ, bó lại với nhau. Đây là Phương pháp Phân mảnh và Hợp nhất.\nPhân mảnh và hợp nhất (cũng như quá trình và phản quá trình) thường được sử dụng trong việc giải quyết các vấn đề phát minh.\nKhi có một mâu thuẫn hai phần - một cái gì đó nên có, và không nên có - có một cách giải quyết hai phần.\nDưới đây là bản dịch tiếng Việt của đoạn văn bản:"

    "text": "Chương 7 Một số điều về các Hệ thống\nNếu con amip có thể nói, nó sẽ nói: “Tổ tiên đơn bào của tôi đã sống trên Trái đất hàng tỷ năm trước. Giờ đây, mọi thứ đều cấu thành từ sự kết hợp của các tế bào đơn. Gỗ chẳng hạn là sự kết hợp của các tế bào. Con người cũng là sự kết hợp của các tế bào. Điều này có nghĩa là Kỷ nguyên của Tế bào vẫn đang tiếp diễn!”\nVới tất cả sự tôn trọng đối với người phát ngôn đơn bào, chúng ta nên phản đối. Gỗ và con người có những đặc điểm khác với các tế bào đơn lẻ. Gỗ cũng như con người đều là các hệ thống của tế bào. Không còn một Kỷ nguyên Tế bào thực sự nữa, mà là một Kỷ nguyên của các Hệ thống.\nSự phát triển của các hệ thống thông qua việc phát triển và phức tạp hóa là một quy luật phổ quát. Trong thế giới kỹ thuật, sự phát triển đi từ một tế bào đến một hệ thống. Một chiếc ô tô là một tế bào, ngành công nghiệp ô tô là một hệ thống. Một chiếc điện thoại là một tế bào, ngành công nghiệp điện thoại là một hệ thống.\nKhi một tế bào đơn lẻ trở thành một phần của hệ thống, nó hoạt động hiệu quả hơn và phát triển nhanh hơn. Đồng thời, tế bào phụ thuộc vào hệ thống và không thể tồn tại mà không có nó.\nCông nghệ đương đại là công nghệ của các hệ thống. Các “tế bào” của nó là các thiết bị, máy móc và thiết bị khác nhau. Chúng hoạt động bên trong hệ thống. Do đó, một số người trong nửa sau của thế kỷ 20 gọi đây là “Thế kỷ của các Hệ thống Kỹ thuật”.\nCó một sự phân cấp nghiêm ngặt bên trong một hệ thống kỹ thuật. Một bóng đèn điện trong ô tô phụ thuộc vào hệ thống điện của xe. Chiếc xe phụ thuộc vào ngành công nghiệp ô tô, bao gồm hàng triệu xe, đường xá, trạm xăng và trạm sửa chữa.\nMọi hệ thống kỹ thuật đều có một hệ thống “cấp trên” ở trên (siêu hệ thống) và một hệ thống “cấp dưới” ở dưới (hệ thống con). Bất kỳ thay đổi nào trong một hệ thống phân cấp đều ảnh hưởng đến cả hai hệ thống. Một mâu thuẫn kỹ thuật xuất hiện vì ai đó quên quy luật này. Một phần của hệ thống có lợi thế hơn so với hệ thống “cấp trên” hoặc “cấp dưới” của nó. Do đó, cần phải xem xét lợi ích không chỉ của hệ thống cần được cải thiện mà còn cả lợi ích của các hệ thống con và siêu hệ thống.\nHãy xem xét một vấn đề cụ thể để học cách xem xét những lợi ích này.\nVấn đề 19 Hãy làm điều đó mà không cần thần giao cách cảm\nCó một lần, một chiếc xe mới bị chết máy trên đường cao tốc. Người lái xe bối rối cố gắng giải thích với hành khách: “Thật xui xẻo. Tôi hết xăng rồi. Tôi quên nhìn đồng hồ xăng!”\n“Điều đó xảy ra,” người hành khách thông cảm nói. “Hơn nữa, những đồng hồ đó không bao giờ hoạt động chính xác. Bình xăng trống rỗng, nhưng kim chỉ còn xa mốc số không. Sẽ tốt nếu có một bình xăng có thể gửi tín hiệu thần giao cách cảm theo cách nào đó khi xăng gần hết!”\nVà đột nhiên Nhà Phát minh xuất hiện.\n“Có thể làm được mà không cần thần giao cách cảm,” anh ta nói. “Tôi có một ý tưởng…”\nNhà phát minh đã đề xuất điều gì?\nHãy phân tích. Ô tô trong trường hợp của chúng ta là một siêu hệ thống. Giải pháp của chúng ta không nên gây nguy hiểm cho bất kỳ “lợi ích” nào của hệ thống đó. Điều này có nghĩa là không nên thay đổi hoặc thiết kế lại bất cứ thứ gì trong ô tô. Điều này điển hình cho bất kỳ siêu hệ thống nào miễn là vấn đề không đòi hỏi những thay đổi mạnh mẽ hoặc thay thế hệ thống đó. Chúng ta sẽ coi đây là một yêu cầu.\nCác hệ thống con cũng có những yêu cầu riêng của chúng. Hệ thống kiểm soát nhiên liệu của xe (hệ thống trung tâm của chúng ta) bao gồm bốn hệ thống con: xăng, bình xăng, một thứ gì đó tạo ra tín hiệu (X - thứ chúng ta sẽ tìm), và đầu của người lái xe. Để bắt đầu, bất kỳ “sửa đổi” nào đối với đầu của người lái xe đều không thể chấp nhận được. Chúng ta cũng không thể xem xét bất kỳ thay đổi nào trong xăng. Còn lại hai hệ thống con: “X” và bình xăng.\nBây giờ, hãy xem xét điều kiện khi không có xăng trong bình - hoặc gần như không có - và có một tín hiệu từ “X”. Hãy nhớ rằng, bình xăng có một yêu cầu rất đơn giản: Nó không thể bị thay đổi. Vì vậy, kết luận là “X” phải gần như bằng không, nếu không thì bình xăng hoặc ô tô phải được sửa đổi. Ví dụ, “X” không thể là một thiết bị tia X vì nó sẽ làm cho xe phức tạp hơn.\nĐến lúc này, các yêu cầu cho siêu hệ thống, hệ thống và các hệ thống con đã trở nên rõ ràng đến mức chúng ta có thể xác định “X” với độ chính xác toán học. Một chút sau tôi sẽ chỉ cho bạn cách làm điều đó. Hãy tự suy nghĩ về nó bây giờ. Bình xăng trống, hoặc gần như trống, nên gửi một tín hiệu đến đầu của người lái xe. Khi bình đầy xăng, không có tín hiệu. Chỉ có “X” có thể giúp chúng ta đạt được điều này. “X” nên nhỏ đến mức cả xe (siêu hệ thống) lẫn xăng (hệ thống con) đều không yêu cầu bất kỳ thay đổi nào khi nó được đưa vào."
